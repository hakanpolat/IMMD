@article{YangChen2004,
abstract = { Printed circuit board (PCB) design has become a crucial issue for high density packaging of power electronics circuits. The traces, loops and vias on the PCB all introduce parasitic inductance, which causes high frequency ringing in the circuit and thus additional losses. In this paper, the inductance of several typical loops and vias on PCB is analyzed using Neumann formula. Studies show that the self-inductance of the rectangular loop is related to the length/width ratio, the trace width as well as the rectangular area. The mutual inductance between two loops is related to their relative position as well as their common area. When a loop contains vias, they may introduce additional inductance due to the additional cross-sectional area formed by the vias, while the vias themselves have little contribution to the inductance in the switching frequency domain. A simple and accurate test circuit was built based on oscillation method to measure the small inductance of loops on the PCB. Experimental results match the theoretical prediction with acceptable errors. Finally, some useful design guidelines are presented to optimize the layouts.},

@techreport{Boxriker,
abstract = {This paper presents a holistic approach to determine the effect of online reconfiguration of the motor winding of a synchronous permanent magnet motor resulting in switching the number of turns. The analysis is based on a parameter plane, which predicts the behavior of synchronous machine designs by using only two normalized parameters, the permanent magnet flux linkage and the ratio of the quadrature axis inductance Lq to the direct axis inductance L d. This enables a fast and reliable evaluation of all alternate winding configurations under given constraints. By generating a Pareto front, superior switching configurations can be identified. An exemplary configurable winding machine-implemented in a finite element analysis (FEA)-shows a significant improvement with respect to maximum torque (increase by 20.3{\%}) and usable torque-speed operating range (increase by 5.5{\%}) compared to the best fixed-winding configuration. The contribution demonstrates that this approach is not only applicable for permanent magnet synchronous motors but also for synchronous reluctance, electrically excited synchronous and induction motors.},

abstract = {This paper investigates differences of parasitic inductances caused by DC bus bar patterns on printed circuit boards(PCB). The DC bus bar pattern on the PCB is limited depending on the layout of main circuits and the control circuits. Two patterns which are a laminated wiring pattern and a plane wiring pattern are compared in experiments and simulations. In this paper, it will be clarified that effects of the DC bus bars on PCBs such as a surge voltage of a switch in terms of the parasitic inductance depending on the circuits on PCBs. As a result, if the same parasitic inductance which is 20 nH, is realized between each wiring pattern at the same length, the plane wiring pattern requires over ten times of the pattern width compared with that of the laminated wiring pattern. Hence, the circuit size can be downsized when the laminated pattern is used. From the experimental results, the maximum surge voltage in the plane wiring pattern is larger than that in the laminated wiring pattern. In this case, the parasitic inductance value of the plane wiring pattern is three times that of the laminated wiring pattern. However, the surge voltage in the laminated pattern is reduced by 7{\%} compared with the plane wiring pattern. As a consequence, the ratio of the surge voltage does not match that of the parasitic inductance. As a result, not only the parasitic inductance of the DC bus bar but also it is necessary to consider other parasitic inductances on PCBs such as parasitic inductances into input capacitors and the path between an upper MOSFET and a lower one and so on.},

The integrated motor design was targeted at pump and fan applications where the need to install motor drives in a separate location is often an impediment to the replacement of fixed speed motors. In order to achieve this objective the thermal and electrical design of the integrated drive have to be considered together. This paper presents the final design that achieves all these objectives, including fully tested and evaluated demonstrations of the power converter and the cooling arrangements. The final integrated motor drive design only differs from a standard motor in terms of one end plate, the terminal box and the shaft driven fan. Full practical results of the 30 kW demonstrator are presented in the paper},

The spectrum of the pulsating phase-leg voltage with discontinuous space vector modulation scheme (DPWM) is analyzed, based on which the relationship between the switching frequency and the EMI filter parameters is studied. Then the rules for selecting line inductance and DC link capacitance are derived from the consideration of the current ripple and system stability requirement. The impact of DC link ripple current and failure mode operation is also included.

Using this approach, weight, volume, reliability, efficiency, and cost CTQ are addressed to develop a balance among them, resulting in an optimized system. The influence of machine controllers and system considerations is discussed. As a part of the machine evaluation process, speeds, bearings, complexity, rotor mechanical and thermal limitations, torque pulsation, current, and power densities, are considered. A methodology for electric machine selection is demonstrated. An example of high-speed, high-performance machine application is shown. A system approach is used for overall electric machine selection and optimization.

abstract = {For future electric vehicles, new converter systems are investigated. Because light weight is one of the main requirements, the passive components (DC-capacitors, chokes, EMI-filters) have to be reduced drastically. Industrial scalability, safe fault behavior and EMI limits are important points, too. These requirements cannot be met with standard topologies, sufficiently. Therefore, new topologies have been studied, which enable essential improvements of these points. This paper describes a new concept of a Modular High Frequency Converter (MHF) suitable for advanced low voltage FETs. Extremely low weight, low power loss and excellent dynamic control behavior are achieved.},

It is prevalently acknowledged that GaN-based switching devices outperform the Si-based counterparts in many aspects such as lower power consumption, and faster switching frequencies. GaN devices will benefit many applications such as hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles, solar power inverters, industrial motor drives, and aerospace. Nevertheless, the superiorities of GaN devices in inverter design have not been fully explored by researchers, and the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the high-efficiency capabilities of inverters that can be achieved using these new devices and the resulting benefits on the thermal aspect. As a case study, 1 kW GaN FETs inverter is considered. Loss and efficiency analysis is performed under various load conditions, and the requirements on heat sink for various ambient temperatures are specified according to the loss values obtained. Analysis results are compared with conventional Si-based inverters.},

abstract = {Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor (GaN HEMT) is an emerging wide band gap power device in recent years. Using a cascoded structure, the GaN HEMT can be combined with a low voltage MOSFET to make the combination behave as a normally-off device. This paper investigates the soft-switching behavior of cascode GaN HEMT in the phase-leg structure. The analysis reveals some internal device behaviors during the soft-switching transition, which are not found in the non-cascode device. Due to the internal feedback of the cascode structure, the channel current of the internal GaN HEMT drops to zero quickly, leading to extremely low turn-off loss. However, it has been found that there are switching energy loss dissipated in the internal GaN HEMT during the turn-on transient, although the external waveforms of the cascode GaN HEMT exhibit zero voltage switching. The fundamental reason is that ratio of the sum of MOSFET output capacitance and internal GaN HEMT input capacitance to the internal GaN HEMT output capacitance is quite low. Based on the simulation, by adding additional capacitance on the gate source terminals of internal GaN HEMT, these losses can be mitigated. Experimental tests using a commercially available GaN device are presented which show nearly 400 mW of loss at 1 MHz switching frequency in four different load current conditions.},

abstract = {To operate motors at a higher efficiency over a wider range of speeds, we have developed a technique that quickly reverses the salient poles in permanent magnet (PM) motors. With this technique, PM motors can change negative salient poles into positive salient poles by applying the magnetization of the PM. Furthermore, we discuss the combi-nation of reversible salient poles with variable magnetic force to increase the efficiency of the motor under partial load. This paper proposes a novel PM motor that uses our proposed technique to reverse saliency and describes the principle of reversible pole saliency as well as the resulting motor characteristics. When the proposed motor operates with a negative salient pole, a higher torque is produced at low speeds; when the motor reverses to a positive salient pole, higher power and efficiency are produced at high speeds. These results confirm that the proposed motor can reverse the saliency direction of the pole and that this reversibility allows the motor to achieve high torque at low speeds and high power at high speeds. Consequently, the motor can operate over a wide range of speeds.},

The example of application is given for two specific three phase windings; the first is characterized by a working harmonic of order five and the second by a working harmonic of order seven.},

abstract = {GaN heterojunction field-effect transistors (HFETs) in the 600-V class are relatively new in commercial power electronics. The GaN Systems GS66508 is the first commercially available 650-V enhancement-mode device. Static and dynamic testing has been performed across the full current, voltage, and temperature range to enable GaN-based converter design using this new device. A curve tracer was used to measure Rds-on across the full operating temperature range, as well as the self-commutated reverse conduction (i.e. diode-like) behavior. Other static parameters such as transconductance and gate current were also measured. A double pulse test setup was constructed and used to measure switching loss and time at the fastest achievable switching speed, and the subsequent over-voltages due to the fast switching were characterized. Based on these results and analysis, an accurate loss model has been developed for the GS66508 to allow for GaN-based converter design and comparison with other commercially available devices in the 600-V class.},

abstract = {-This paper designed the gate driver circuits and optimized the PCB layout in a 7.2kW battery charger using paralleled GaN HEMTs. 650V/60A enhancement mode GaN HEMTs provided by GaN Systems Inc are adopted. To optimize the switching performance of paralleled GaN HEMTs with low loss and high reliability, effects of parasitic inductance and capacitance are modeled and analyzed. Through cancelling the flux in the commutation loop, the power-loop parasitic inductance is reduced to only 0.7nH, which significantly decreases the electrical stress in the switch turn-off process. A diverse-parameter gate driver design has been proposed to achieve the reliable switching off. The Finite-Element-Analysis and Spice simulation show our current design could effectively suppress the voltage overshoot and gate-drive ringing on HEMTs. Experiments were carried out on both double pulse test platform and the 7.2kW charger to verify the proposed design strategy.},

abstract = {Enhancement-mode GaN HFETs enable efficient high-frequency converter design, but this technology is relatively new and exhibits different characteristics from Si or SiC MOSFETs. GaN performance at elevated temperature is especially unique. Turn-on time increases significantly with temperature, and turn-on losses increase as a result. This phenomenon can be explained based on the relationships between junction temperature and GaN device transconductance, and between transconductance and turn-on time. An analytical relationship between temperature and turn-on loss has been derived for the 650-V GS66508 from GaN Systems, and verified with experimental results. Based on this relationship, a detailed model is developed, and a simplified scaling factor is proposed for estimating turn-on loss in e-mode GaN HFETs, using room-temperature switching characterization and typically published datasheet parameters.},

abstract = {— The medium power rating two-level three phase voltage source inverter is among the most popular power conversion systems. The typical switching frequency of the commercial medium power rating inverter, however, is limited to tens of kHz. By increasing the switching frequency and using emerging gallium-nitride devices, the size of the overall system can be greatly reduced. This paper begins by reviewing all commercially available GaN power transistors and their package technologies. The GS66516T device from GaN Systems is selected due to its suitable ratings and superior package performance. Then, a half-bridge structure is designed for this device to achieve low parasitic inductance and strong cooling capability at the same time. The dynamic characterization results of this 650V/60A Enhancement-mode GaN transistor are extracted with the proposed half-bridge structure. A gate drive circuit with comprehensive protection function is integrated. Based on the proposed phase-leg structure, a 10 kW three phase inverter prototype is built and the experimental waveform is shown at the end.},

Among challenges and requirements of on-going electrification process and future transportation systems there is demand for arrangements with both increased fault tolerance and reliability. Next aerospace, power-train and automotive systems exploiting new technologies are delving for new features and functionalities. Multi-three phase arrangements are one of these novel approaches where future implementation of aforementioned applications will benefit from. This paper presents and analyses distributed current control design for asymmetrical split-phase schemes composed by symmetrical three phase sections with even number of phases. The proposed design within the dq0 reference frame in nominal, open and short circuit condition of one three-phase system is compared with the vector space decomposition technique and further validated by mean of Matlab/Simulink{\textregistered} simulations.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. All rights reserved. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a key technology in the food industry that facilitates real-time visibility of items as they move through the supply chain and on to the end-consumer. Among all the currently available automatic identification technologies, RFID has clear dominance in terms of its ability to support real-time two-way communication, data storage and update, authentication, ambient condition sense and report, batch read without direct line-of-sight, operation in harsh environments and sensor-based applications. RFID and Sensor Network Automation in the Food Industry provides sufficient detail on the use of RFID and sensor networks from `farm to fork? (F2F) to allow the reader to appreciate the myriad possible applications of RFID and associated sensor network systems throughout the entire food supply chain. This includes precision agriculture, the provision of seamless visibility in track and trace applications, reduction of wastage, identification of counterfeits and contamination sources, remaining shelf-life applications for perishables, and quality and safety measures, among others. Providing state-of-the-art information from peer-reviewed research publications as well as general industry trends, this book will be of interest to all stakeholders in the agri-food supply chain, and academics and advanced students with an interest in these fields.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 assigned jointly to the European Power Electronics and Drives Association  {\&}  the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). An integration of an electric motor and a drive with wide bandgap (WBG) devices possesses numerous attractive features for electrified and decentralized actuation systems. The WBG devices are capable of operating at high junction temperature ( {\textless} 170 °C) with improved efficiency due to fast switching speed and low on-state resistance. It also leads to better performance and higher power density electrohydrostatic actuators than the traditional solutions, which are being widely adopted in industrial applications such as aerospace, robotics, automobiles, manufacturing, wind turbine, and off-road vehicles. This paper introduces and investigates the benefits of the integrated motor drive (IMD) with the WBG-based power electronics for the electro-hydrostatic actuation systems.},

@article{Jones2017,
abstract = {A fast overcurrent protection scheme was developed for GaN gate injection transistors (GITs), harnessing the relationship between the externally measured vgs and id in steady-state operation. This relationship has been characterized in both static and dynamic testing over a wide range of operating conditions, and a circuit has been constructed to implement this control scheme. The circuit uses analog components to integrate the protection feature into a commercially available GIT gate driver. The scheme was experimentally verified in a double pulse test setup for experimental verification, and its total fault response time was recorded at less than 70 ns, with 400 V dc bus and a 30 A threshold. Compared with conventional desaturation protection, which detects faults based on drain voltage rather than gate voltage, the proposed scheme offers benefits in terms of speed, temperature invariance, flexibility in threshold selection, and minimal impact on the GIT's normal switching behavior.},

abstract = {Common-mode (CM) voltage and related conducted CM electromagnetic interference (EMI) can cause ground leakage current, motor bearing failures, and audio susceptibility issues in pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) voltage-source inverter (VSI) motor drive applications. When using wide-bandgap (WBG) devices to build motor drive inverters operating at higher switching frequencies, the problems caused by a VSI's CM EMI become more serious. As an alternative, the current-source inverter (CSI) delivers more sinusoidal output voltage waveforms and its dc-link inductor helps to suppress the CM current, making it a promising topology that inherently reduces the motor drive's CM EMI. The conducted EMI generation mechanisms of two-level VSIs and CSIs are evaluated, with detailed discussion of their conducted CM EMI voltage sources and resultant current paths. CM equivalent circuits of both inverters are derived, and the resulting CM EMI transfer functions are employed to assist fast CM EMI estimation and evaluation of means for its suppression. Additionally, the impact of WBG devices and alternative space-vector PWM (SVPWM) strategies on CM EMI are examined.

For a power electronics engineer accustomed to Si-based converter design, there is inherent benefit to understanding the unique characteristics and challenges that distinguish GaN HFETs from Si MOSFETs. Dynamic Rds-on, self-commutated reverse conduction, gate voltage and current requirements, and the effects of very fast switching are explained from an applications perspective. This paper reviews available literature on commercial and near-commercial GaN HFETs, to prepare engineers with Si-based power electronics experience to effectively design GaN-based converters},

The application requirements are high torque per weight, low torque ripple, a compact external- rotor configuration integral to the rotor hub, air-cooling and fault tolerance. Fault tolerance is achieved by configuring the machine radially as four separate three-phase star connected windings. Analytical and finite element analysis, as well as prototype testing and results, are presented for normal working and different fault scenarios showing the benefit of the configuration in minimising torque ripple and additional losses during faulted operation.},

The optimization has been carried out using Differential Evolution algorithm implemented in Matlab combined with SPEED and MotorCAD software packages for electromagnetic and thermal modeling of the BLDC motor using ActiveX technology. The credibility of the models created with SPEED and MotorCAD has been confirmed by comparing the results of simulation and measurement performed on a 12 kW synchronous permanent magnet motor available in the laboratory. The goal of the optimization has been to minimize the weight of the motor under condition that the motor delivers rated power of 15 kW at rated speed of 3000 rpm with hot-spot temperature not exceeding the temperature limits of class F insulation (155 ◦ C). Two optimal BLDC motor designs with slot/pole combinations 12/10 and 18/16 have been obtained. The motor with 18 slots and 16 poles yields the highest torque density with the lowest mass of active parts (copper+laminations+magnets) of only 5.1 kg.},

Employing resonance-energy-transfer probes containing either the caspase-8 recognition site IETD or full-length Bid, we observed a significant delay between the times of caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage, suggesting the existence of control steps separating these two processes. Subsequent analyses suggested that the divergence of caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage are critically controlled by kinase signalling: inhibiting protein kinase CK2 by using 5,6-dichloro-l-(beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1)-benzimidazole (DRB) or by overexpression of a dominant-negative CK2alpha catalytic subunit largely eliminated the lag time between caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage. We conclude that caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage are temporally uncoupled events, providing transient tolerance to caspase-8 activities.},

GaN devices will benefit many applications such as hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles, solar power inverters, industrial motor drives, and aerospace. Nevertheless, the superiorities of GaN devices in inverter design have not been fully explored by researchers, and the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the high-efficiency capabilities of inverters that can be achieved using these new devices and the resulting benefits on the thermal aspect. As a case study, 1 kW GaN FETs inverter is considered. Loss and efficiency analysis is performed under various load conditions, and the requirements on heat sink for various ambient temperatures are specified according to the loss values obtained. Analysis results are compared with conventional Si-based inverters.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Gallium Nitride enhancement-mode high electron mobility transistors (GaN E-HEMTs) can achieve relatively high-efficiency and high-frequency in hard-switching mode. One particular reason is that GaN E-HEMTs obtain zero reverse-recovery loss and also a zero reverse-recovery period. For silicon (Si) MOSFETs, it has been a well-known issue that their Qrris too big to switch the transistor in hard-switching mode. Researchers have made extensive efforts to calculate the reverse-recovery loss. However, few of them pay attention to the Qoss, as the Qrrdominates in the turn-on switching loss for Si MOSFETs. For GaN HEMTs, the absence of the Qrrmakes the Qossnoticeable, although the value of the Qossfor GaN HEMTs is still the smallest among both Si and Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs. This paper focus on the Eqoss loss in GaN HEMTs. The Eqoss loss mechanism, detailed calculation and detailed measurement method for GaN HEMTs are provided. In addition, the theoretical results are verified by the double-pulse test at different junction temperatures and gate resistances.},

abstract = {— Industry is adopting GaN HEMT in 10kW-100kW and higher power systems due to the ultra-fast switching capabilities of GaN. Paralleling GaN HEMT transistors is an appealing idea to further increase the power capability and reduce conduction losses of systems. The characteristics of E-mode GaN HEMT, such as positive temperature coefficient of RDS(ON) and a temperature independent threshold voltage, are very suitable for paralleling devices. However, the main challenge for parallel operation is thought to be the diverse parasitics of the power stage and gate driver circuits, which are very sensitive to the high di/dt and dv/dt during the switching process. In this paper, an analytic model for the switching process of paralleled GaN HEMT transistors is built to analyze the effects of parasitics and device characteristics on paralleling, and the design consideration for gate driver and layout is also presented. A half bridge power stage consisting of four high-side and four low-side 60 A / 650 V GaN HEMTs in parallel is designed to undertake 240 A / 400 V hard switching on and off. Double pulse testing results are presented to confirm GaN paralleling capability.},

The objective of this paper is to examine the future of integrated motor drive tech-nology by first reviewing the history of IMD products from the 1960s to today, highlighting both the reasons for their success as well the significant technical obstacles that they had to overcome. Special attention is directed to the application of IMD technology to electric vehicle traction motor drives during the past 15 years. A long-term vision for IMDs is presented that calls for embedding the drive electronics directly inside the machine enclosure. In keeping with this vision, wide-bandgap (WBG) power semiconduc-tor switches (SiC and GaN) offer exciting prospects for shrinking the size of power converters and simplifying their cooling require-ments. New concepts for applying this WBG technology to IMDs are introduced, including revived interest in PWM current-source inverters. In the concluding section, a variety of other promising technologies are introduced that will be critical to realizing the full potential of integrated motor drives.

abstract = {The selection of an appropriate modulation scheme plays a vital role to assure the performance of multilevel inverters. Space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) is more efficient among all other pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques due to its key characteristics like better DC voltage utilization, switching losses reduction and easiness in digital implementation. The conventional SVPWM scheme presents some computational complexities due to redundant switching states and large number of space vectors. This paper summarizes five different SVPWM techniques for multilevel inverters which are {\&}{\#}x03B1;-{\&}{\#}x03B2; frame, g-h frame, K-L frame, {\&}{\#}x03B1;{\&}{\#}x2032;-{\&}{\#}x03B2;{\&}{\#}x2032; frame and SVPWM based on imaginary coordinate system. g-h frame and K-L frame are based on 60{\&}{\#}x00B0; and 120{\&}{\#}x00B0; coordinates system respectively. To compare the result of these SVPWM schemes, the complex calculations of conventional SVP-WM are converted into simplified line voltages form. The comparison results validate all the SVPWM techniques, but the SVPWM based on imaginary coordinate is found more simple in duty ratio calculations, easier to understand and provides a better control for zero-sequence component for any level of inverter.},

abstract = {Many geared electric drives can benefit from removing the gearbox and driving directly the load at low speed using a permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are particularly attractive in low-speed direct drives since they allow, among other advantages, a high number of poles with a limited number of slots. Therefore, this thesis is dedicated to PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings designed for low-speed directdrive applications. First, the design features specific to PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are presented and illustrated with examples based on finite-element (FE) simulations. Especially, it is shown that the selections of the stator core manufacturing method, the number of winding layers, the combination of pole and slot numbers, and the geometry of the tooth tips are crucial during the design stage of the machine. Second, the benefits of removing the gearbox in a 4.5 kW, 50 rpm mixer used in a waste-water treatment plant are investigated. With its PMSM having buried ferrite magnets and concentrated windings, the designed direct-drive mixer has a higher efficiency than the commercialized geared mixer, but it is also heavier and more expensive due to the larger required housing, shaft and seals. In addition, the cost of the stator core and coil assembly was also higher than expected. Therefore, the difficulties in manufacturing a stator core with concentrated windings are investigated. Mainly due to economical aspects, no prototype motor has been built for the direct-drive mixer. Finally, measurements on a prototype motor at disposal having a large constantpower speed range are performed. Three methods to measure the inductances without using a position sensor are provided and compared. One of the methods is a new test at load conditions to determine the inductance without the knowledge of the rotor position. Results from this method agree well with a conventional blocked rotor test, as well as with results from 3D-FE simulations. Furthermore, the measurements of the magnetic flux obtained with search coils placed in different parts of the stator are analyzed. The analysis allows highlighting the zigzag flux flowing from one magnet to another through a tooth tip, which is characteristic of PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings. It is shown that this zigzag flux leakage causes high iron losses in the tooth tips that represent approximately 50{\%} of the stator iron losses under field weakening operation. Using these measurements, the 3D-FE model of the prototype is also validated thoroughly.},

The power electronic components were mounted on the inside of a new end cover which was equipped with an extensive array of fins cooled by air from the external fan. The electronic components were insulated from the air in the end region of the motor. A heat sink plate was installed within the motor behind the end cover to conduct the heat from the motor that would otherwise have been dissipated through the end cover. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the ventilation and heat transfer from the new end cover and to develop improved fan geometries. It was concluded that CFD can be used effectively to design motor cooling systems.

abstract = {The flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) motor has been viewed as a highly reliable machine with both armature windings and magnets on the stator. Owing to the high torque-production capability with low torque ripple, FSPM motors with a higher number of phases are potential candidates for traction applications in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). However, existing research has mostly focused on the principles and static performance of multiphase FSPM motors, and little attention has been paid to advanced control strategies. In this paper, the fully decoupled current control of a 36/34-pole nine-phase FSPM (NP-FSPM) motor is developed and the performance under different operating conditions is investigated. The aim of the design is to alleviate cross coupling effects and unwanted low-order stator harmonic currents, to guarantee fast transient response and small steady-state error. In addition, its fault-tolerance is further elaborated. These features are very important in automotive applications where low torque pulsation, high fault-tolerant capability and high dynamic performance are of major importance. Firstly, the research status of multiphase FSPM motors is briefly reviewed. Secondly, the mathematical model in the dq reference frames and control strategies are presented. Then, the control and performance of the NP-FSPM motor are evaluated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, experiments on an NP-FSPM motor prototype are carried out to validate the study.},

abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is one of the well-known and effective strategies adopted in distribution network. The goal of DFR problem is to obtain a new topological structure for distribution feeders by rearranging the status of switches such that an optimal configuration would be obtained. The existence of Distributed Generation (DG) can affect the entire power system and especially distribution networks. This paper presents an efficient approach for multi-objective DFR problem considering the simultaneous effect of DG units. The objective functions to be investigated are 1) power losses, 2) voltage deviation of buses, 3) emission produced by DG units and distribution companies and 4) the total cost of the active power generated by DG units and distribution companies. The new evolutionary method is based on an efficient multi-objective hybrid honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) called MHBMO-SFLA. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates the outstanding characteristics of SFLA to improve the performance of HBMO algorithm sufficiently. In the proposed MHBMO-SFLA, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated solutions which are found during the search process. Also, since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is utilized to control the size of the repository within the limits. A distribution test feeder is considered to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} Shiraz University.},

The results indicate the thermal resistance from the simulation is significantly affected by compact thermal via configurations. Thermal resistance can be improved by increasing via number and also with copper filled via. For further explanation of the significant drop of thermal resistance at PCBs with thermal via, the detailed thermal resistance distribution at the thermal module are further examined. The significant drop in thermal resistance mainly occur in FR-4 PCBs with the help of thermal via. However, there is observed a maximum number of via which contribute to optimized thermal resistance across the PCB. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {In order to improve aircraft efficiency, reliability and maintainability, the aerospace world has found in the progressive electrification of on-board services the way to reduce or to remove the presence of the hydraulic, mechanical and the bleed air/pneumatic systems. This concept is called more electric aircraft (MEA), which involves the introduction of the electromechanical actuators (EMAs) and the electro-hydraulics actuators (EHAs) for the actuation of the flight surfaces of wide-body aircraft, moving from the {\^{A}}¿fly-by wire{\^{A}}¿ to the {\^{A}}¿power-by wire{\^{A}}¿ concept. The resulting step change in aircraft electrical loading will have far reaching implications for the electrical generation system. Considerable effort is being directed towards realizing the so-called more electric engine (MEE), which foresee an integration of the electrical generator directly inside the main gas turbine engine. Also the entire electrical distribution system is subject to radical revisiting, with a trend which is leaving the constant frequency AC energy distribution in favor of variable frequency or DC solutions. Hence, it is evident the MEA trend increments the technical challenges and research topics for the electrical engineering in the aeronautic applications. The aim of the paper is the presentation, from the electrical engineering point of view, of some of the most challenging application of electric machines and drives in the incoming new aircraft generation. There are too many on board electric components and systems to be analyzed: the authors centre the attention on the most safety critical drives: flight surface actuators, fuel pumps and generators.},

Removal of the engine hydraulic pumps requires fully-operative electrical power actuators and mastery of the flight control architecture. The paper presents a general overview of the electrical power generation system and electric drives for the MEA, with special regard to the flight controls.

abstract = {Currently, assemblies of power semiconductor switches and their associated drive circuitry are available in modules. MOSFETs and IGBTs are used as switches and these elec- tric gated devices facilitate the incorporation of gate driving functions in the module. These mod- ules are sometimes also provided with limited internal sensing and protection functions. From a few 100 watts downward, one finds silicon monolithic technology as the integration vehicle, while upward into the multi-kilowatt range, mixed mode module construction is used. This incorporates monolithic, hybrid, surface mount and wirebond technology. However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors) and interconnect structures. The article addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced inte- gration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced inte- gration. The central philosophy of the technology development research in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Power Electronic Systems is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs).

@article{Kanerva2009,
abstract = {Available solutions for redundancy in electric propulsion are outlined, emphasizing their benefits and drawbacks. Two different state-of-the art solutions of redundant electric propulsion are presented. The first example is a cruise ship with two azimuthal thrusters, both of which are equipped with 18 to 21 MW dual-stator synchronous motors and driven by two voltage source inverters (VSI) in a redundant configuration. The phase shift between the stator windings in each motor is 30 degrees, and the motors can also operate with only one stator system in case that another system is lost. The second example is LNG carriers, where one propeller is driven through a gearbox by two 12 to 15 MW dual-stator synchronous motors. The motors are supplied by VSI-type frequency converters with double inverter units and supply units, allowing each motor to operate in half power mode in case of a fault in any of these modules. The both configurations provide 75{\%} redundancy in case of the most common single faults without notably increasing the cost and complexity of the system.},

In this paper, a gallium nitride (GaN)-based 2-kVA single-phase inverter design was developed for the Google Little Box Challenge, which achieves a 102-W/in3 power density. First, the static and dynamic temperature-dependent character- istics of multiple SiC and enhancement-mode GaN FETs are investigated and compared. Based on the device testing results, several topologies of the inverter stage and different power decoupling solutions are compared with respect to the device volume, efficiency, and thermal requirements. Moreover, some design approaches for magnetic devices and the implementation of gate drives for GaN devices are discussed in this paper, which enable a compact and robust system. Finally, a dc notch filter and a hard switching full-bridge converter are combined as the proposed design for the prototype. A 2-kVA prototype is demonstrated, which meets the volume, efficiency, and thermal requirements. The performance of the prototype is verified by the experimental results},

@article{McDonald2017,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to optimize direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generators for offshore direct drive wind turbines in order to reduce the cost of energy. A 6 MW wind turbine design is assumed and parametric electromagnetic and structural generator models are introduced for a surface-mounted magnet generator topology (using magnets with high BHmax) and a flux-concentrating variant (using magnets with lower BHmax). These are optimized using a hybrid genetic algorithm and pattern search process and the results show that the surface-mounted permanent magnet generator produces the lower cost of energy. The choice of objective function is addressed and it is found that a simplified metric incorporating generator cost and losses proxy produces similar designs to a full cost of energy calculation. Further steps to improve the quality of the model include the effect of generator mass on the design and cost of the turbine tower and foundation, which can add €0.4 m to the turbine cost. Further optimizations are carried out to show the impacts of magnetic material costs (doubling this leads to a €1.1/MWh increase in cost of energy) and generator diameter limits (increasing the upper limit from 6 to 8 m leads to a 0.9{\%} drop in cost of energy) have on the choice of optimum independent variables.},

Segmentation is shown to improve the production process, reduce losses, and remove the need for wedges, while not significantly altering the acoustic performance. In the first series of prototypes, however, where notching is used to secure lamination packs, the process is shown to have adversely affected material properties of the nickel iron laminations and overall measured losses increased. In the second prototype, with thinner laminations and glued stacks, iron loss predictions and measurement agree and are less than the present slot wedge design. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

This paper presents a five-phase permanent magnet brushless motor drive developed for an aircraft flap actuator application. The motor is designed to satisfy the load specifications with one or two phases open or with a phase short circuited, while a failure in the rotor position sensors is remedied through a sensorless strategy. Design studies aiming to predict the faulty mode performance in case of different remedial strategies are presented. Experimental tests on the drive prototype are included, which confirm its capability to satisfy the planned degraded modes of operation.},

abstract = {Silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFETs and gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron mobility transistors are perceived as future replacements for Si IGBTs and MOSFETs in medium- and low-voltage drives due to their low conduction and switching losses. However, it is widely believed that the already significant conducted common-mode (CM) electromagnetic interference (EMI) emission of motor drives will be further exacerbated by the high-speed switching operation of these new devices. Hence, this paper investigates and quantifies the increase in the conducted CM EMI emission of a pulse width modulation inverter-based motor drive when SiC and GaN devices are adopted. Through an analytical approach, the results reveal that the influence of dv/dt on the conducted CM emission is generally limited. On the other hand, the influence of switching frequency is more significant. Lab tests are also conducted to verify the analysis. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Furthermore, a concentrated, single-layer, and alternate-teeth-wound winding is adopted to enhance the fault isolation capacity of the motor. In addition, we propose a new approach to the speed control of the developed motor, which takes the electromagnetic torque ripple in the fault switch process into account. The control can guarantee the uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the system regardless of the load disturbance and the parameter variation, particularly for the fault switch process after a fault occurrence before the fault-tolerant control can take effect. Moreover, an optimal torque control is adopted to further improve the fault-tolerant performance, which enables a ripple-free torque operation under open-circuit and short-circuit fault conditions. Simulation and experimental results show that the FTPMSM system with the proposed control strategy has excellent fault-tolerant performance and good robustness. This paper provides an innovative approach by employing a robust control for a speed loop to guarantee the fault-tolerant performance of the proposed motor system under normal and fault conditions, even in the fault switch process.},

abstract = {An improved gate driver is presented which significantly lowers the output noise of high-precision switch-mode (Class-D) power amplifiers by reducing signal jitter at the output of the power stage tenfold to values below 20 ps. Gate signal jitter in power electronic converters, which introduces wideband noise to the power output, originates mainly from the signal isolators that are required to provide the galvanically isolated gate driver control signals. A low-jitter gate control signal is produced by employing a digital flip-flop, which uses a low-jitter isolated clock, to re-synchronize the jittery gate control signal. By utilizing the clock-enable input of the flip-flop, the gate driver can be rendered immune to high-speed common-mode transients, which is important as the Class-D power amplifier demonstrator system employs fast-switching GaN E-HEMT transistors, where the 400V switching transients exceed 300 kV $\mu$s?1.

@article{Prieto2015,
abstract = {This paper obtains analytical expressions for the calculation of the slot leakage inductance for fractional- slot concentrated-winding (FCSW) machines with one-, two-, or four-layer windings. The formulas are derived from solving the 2-D Poisson problem associated with the slot region, making them more accurate than classically used expressions that assume a leakage flux path parallel to the placement of the conductors in the slot. Explicit formulas are given in the case of one- and two-layer FSCWs with a number of phases ranging from 3 to 7. The obtained analytical expressions are validated by a finite-element analysis, showing excellent agreement between both calculation methods, even for large slot-opening-to-slot-pitch ratios. A brief comment with regard to the fault-tolerant capability of permanent-magnet FSCW machines with respect to the number of layers is also given.},

@article{Cao2012,
abstract = {This paper presents an overview of motor drive technologies used for safety-critical aerospace applications, with a particular focus placed on the choice of candidate machines and their drive topologies. Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.},

Aerospace applications involve essentially safety-critical systems which should be able to overcome hardware or software faults and therefore need to be fault tolerant.

Looking at motor drives, multiphase machines, such as multiphase brushless dc machines, are considered to be good candidates in the design of fault-tolerant aerospace motor drives.

Open-circuit faults in stator windings of the machine as well as switches of the inverter are analyzed. The optimization objective is to produce ripple-free electromagnetic torque with minimum ohmic losses under open-circuit fault conditions. This is achieved by a simple closed-form equation to calculate reference optimal currents in all cases where a lookup table is utilized to represent the effect of fault type. The proposed FTC technique is easily extended to PM machines with higher number of phases. Experimental results for a five-phase PM machine drive are provided to demonstrate the proposed FTC strategy.

abstract = {Power converters are complex devices subject to failures that can lead to undesired stops. For this reason, many fault-tolerant topologies and strategies have been deeply studied, mainly focusing on improving the electromechanical behavior of the reconfigured drive after the fault. However, it is also very important to evaluate the possible increase of power losses. In this paper, a power loss analysis is performed on a current-controlled three-phase inverter supplying a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (just chosen as an example), for all the operating modes, starting from the fault occurrence until the faulty operation mode is established. This is particularly important because the effectiveness of a fault-tolerant control strategy depends on the possibility to maintain a continuous operation. The latter is ensured only if there is no such increment of the losses that the survival of the component is at risk. The simulations are validated by means of experimental tests, and the results are discussed. The method can be easily applied to other topologies and reconfiguration strategies.},

The choice of the proper combination of the number of slots and number of poles, together with the corresponding winding layout, has a strong impact on the PM machine performance, in terms of torque density, torque ripple, magnetomotive force harmonic content, and induced rotor losses, as well as the capability to limit the short-circuit current and other fault-tolerance features. Considering these characteristics, this paper aims to help the PM machine designer to select the proper winding configuration, giving useful indications. The winding choice criteria are given using analytical equations, so that their implementation is easy. In this way, the collection of such criteria becomes a helpful tool in the design process.},

The only measurements required for the parameter extraction are simple I-V static characteristics and C-V characteristics. A double-pulse test-bench is built to characterize the resistive and inductive switching behavior of the GaN device. A simulation model is built in Pspice software tool, considering the parasitic elements from associated with the PCB interconnections and other components (load resistor, load inductor and current shunt monitor). The Pspice simulation results are compared with experimental results. The comparison shows good agreement between simulation and experimental results under both resistive and inductive switching conditions.

abstract = {The requirements for driving gallium nitride (GaN) heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) and the design of a resonant drive circuit for GaN power HFET switches are discussed in this paper. The use of wideband III-nitride (such as GaN) devices today is limited to telecom and low-power applications. The current lack of high-frequency high-power drivers prevents their application in power converters. The proposed circuit is based upon resonant switching transition techniques, by means of an LC tag, to recover part of the power back into the voltage source in order to reduce the power loss. This circuit also uses level shifters to generate the zero and negative gate-source voltages required to turn the GaN HFET on and off, and it is highly tolerant to input-signal timing variances. The circuit reduces the overall power consumed in the driver and thus reduces the power loss. This is particularly important for high-frequency driver operation to take full advantage, in terms of efficiency, of the superior switching speed of GaN devices. In this paper, the topology of the low-power-loss high-speed drive circuit is introduced. Some simulation results and preliminary experimental measurements are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of the input voltage unbalance and sags on the dc-bus electrolytic capacitors in adjustable-speed drives (ASDs) in order to predict their impact on expected capacitor lifetime. The key phenomenon that causes these problems is the transition of the rectifier stage from three-phase to single-phase operation. Since the equivalent series resistance increases at low frequencies, the low-order harmonic current components (e.g., 120 and 240 Hz) contribute disproportionately to the capacitor power losses and temperature rise, resulting in reduced lifetime. Closed-form expressions are developed for predicting these effects including the impact of finite line impedance, finite bus capacitance, and varying load. The impact of inverter space-vector pulsewidth-modulation switching on the capacitor loss is also included. Simulations and experimental tests are used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the closed-form analysis using a 5-hp ASD system},

abstract = {Thermal management plays a pivotal role in achieving high power densities in converters. Improvement on thermal performance of critical components in printed-circuit board (PCB) assembled switch mode converters is achieved by using design techniques that extend across electromagnetic, geometrical, and thermal-integration technologies. For better use of the already available PCB material, three-dimensional component layout and flexible PCB technology are utilized to gain advantages. A theory to evaluate the thermal-management effectiveness of switch mode converters is introduced based on two new figures of merit, namely thermal-management loss density and thermal-design rating. These two figures of merit quantify the effective use of thermal-management material as well as the thermal performance of a converter design. The figure-of-merit criteria allow flexibility so that it can be adjusted to an appropriate design objective. Design objectives include achieving higher power densities or achieving good reliability. The thermal-management-effectiveness theory is applied here to thermally optimize a Flyback converter that has been geometrically integrated. The design technique to adjust the thermal-management effectiveness of integrated switch mode converters to achieve a set objective, by means of the introduced figures of merit, forms the core of the publication, validated by experimental measurements},

abstract = {Pulsewidth modulation has been one of the most intensively investigated areas of power electronics for many years, and the number and combination of permutations seem to be endless. However, a general hierarchical consensus appears to have emerged from this work which ranks space vector modulation techniques, regular sampled modulation, and sine-triangle modulation strategies in decreasing order of merit based on harmonic performance. However, what has not been clearly identified is why space vector modulation should lead to a reduced harmonic current ripple compared to regular sampled modulation, especially since it is straightforward to show that they produce identical low-frequency fundamental components. This paper addresses this issue by showing how it is the placement of the zero space vector component within the carrier interval that determines the harmonic performance of the modulation strategy, rather than any intrinsic differences between the various methods of calculating the switching instances},

abstract = {Pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) ac drives generate high differential-mode (DM) motor voltages due to the reflected wave phenomenon. The common-mode (CM) voltage produced by a PWM inverter also has fast transitions that result in high peak currents to ground. For low-power ac drives, this can present several issues, such as pump-up of the dc bus and failure of the power module due to high instantaneous currents that are often undetected because of the typical sampling algorithm used. In this paper, existing drive output filter solutions are reviewed, and a new filter design is presented, which has integrated DM and CM impedance with damping matched to typical cable surge impedance. This eliminates reflections of both DM and CM traveling waves and also reduces peak cable charging currents. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the new filter has improved performance to reduce motor DM and CM voltages and drive output CM current, thus mitigating the issues specifically seen with low-power ac drives. Complete design details for the filter and a particular implementation of the integrated DM and CM reactor are also presented.},

Since the motor is housed in the limited space within the wheel rim, it must have high torque density and efficiency and survive the rigors of being in-wheel in terms of environmental cycling, ingress, shock and vibration, and driver abuse. Finally, to ensure that adequate levels of functional safety are met, it is essential that failures do not lead to the loss of control of the vehicle. This paper presents studies of a fault-tolerant concept for the design of in-wheel motors.

Analytical formulas of the machine's cogging torque are first derived. The new technique is compared with conventional cogging torque suppression methods by means of analytical models and comprehensive finite-element analysis (FEA). The FEA results show that the new method not only achieves effective cogging torque reduction, but also results in improved harmonic content of the back EMF. The validity of the FEA model is verified by experimental results from the prototype machines. Finally, the significance of optimizing both the load-independent machine design techniques and load-dependent driving techniques to achieve overall torque ripple minimization is discussed.},

Based on the analysis, the impact of interleaving on the design of ac passive components, such as ac line inductor and electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter, is discussed. The results show that interleaving has the potential benefit to reduce ac passive components.

In this paper, the modular ac/dc converter system suitable for such a high-voltage generator is analyzed for normal operation and fault-tolerant modes. The control synthesis is addressed, based on an assumption that the control can be designed modularly. Additionally, the investigated control system can facilitate fault- tolerant operation without changing the main structure. The robustness of the module control system is analyzed, and the limits for fault-tolerant operation are investigated. The theoretical studies are supported by transient analysis through simulations of the turbine in EMTDC/PSCAD. Finally, the generator/converter solution is verified experimentally. The laboratory results were obtained using a 45 kWprototype with three generator segments and three converter units in series.},

abstract = {Permanent-magnet (PM) motors offer potential energy savings as compared with induction motors because of the virtual elimination of rotor loss and the reduction of stator loss from operation near unity power factor. In PM machines, iron losses form a significant fraction of the total loss partly due to the nonsinusoidal flux density distribution. Design optimization therefore requires good means of predicting these iron losses. Finite-element analysis can be employed but this approach is cumbersome and costly when used in the many iterations needed in optimizing the design. This paper presents a set of improved approximate models for the prediction of iron loss. They can be used in design optimization programs and, since they are directly related to machine dimensions and material properties, they also provide quick insight into the effects of design changes. A time-stepped finite-element method is employed to evaluate the iron losses in a range of typical PM machines and the results are used to evaluate the adequacy of the models. The predictions of overall iron losses are then compared with measurements made on two PM motors.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a stator design that consists of a combination of an alternate slot winding and dummy slots to minimize pulsating torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors. The alternate arrangement of winding coils is designed to eliminate a harmonic component of back electromotive force that gives rise to a harmonic component of pulsating torque. However, the non-uniform arrangement of slots decreases the frequency of the cogging torque by half and may aggravate torque pulsation. To compensate for the drawback or the decrease in the frequency of the cogging torque, dummy slots are introduced in the alternately slotted stator. A theoretical method is developed for the proposed stator combination. The proposed stator design is applied to a prototype in combination with other rotor magnet design techniques, such as magnet shifting and the adjustment of magnet width, to minimize pulsating torque. The results show that the designed motor reduces the ripple factor of the torque by approximately 30{\%} relative to the original value. In addition, the proposed alternate slot winding is validated by comparing the design with equal slot-winding designs optimized through finite-element method analysis.},

The model enables the magnetic field distribution in the air gap and magnet regions to be determined, by neglecting the eddy-current redistribution effect and assuming that the eddy currents are resistance limited. It can account for space-harmonic magnetomotive forces (MMFs) resulting from the winding distribution and time-harmonic MMFs due to nonsinusoidal phase currents, as well as for the effect of curvature and circumferential segmentation of the magnets. We have validated the model by finite-element analysis, and used it to investigate the eddy-current loss in the magnets of three surface-mounted magnet brushless motors that have similar slot and pole numbers, and employ identical rotors but different stators, when they are operated in brushless ac (BLAC) and dc (BLDC) modes.

abstract = {Iron losses in permanent-magnet synchronous machines form a larger portion of the total losses than in induction machines and, hence, more importance should be given to the iron losses. Previously, models have been presented for the calculations of these losses, but these models still rely on finite-element simulations to obtain correction factors, which are substantial, to apply to the theoretically derived formulas in order to obtain good agreement with the experimental data. This paper points out the source of this correction factor: the neglect of the excess eddy-current loss component. In many cases, this loss component dominates the total iron losses and needs to be incorporated in the theoretical considerations. The paper also provides a more complete model of iron loss, which greatly reduces the need for calculating the correction factors using the finite-element method (FEM). This more complete model reduces design time, especially when a number of candidate designs need to be analyzed. Otherwise, the calculation of the correction factors using FEM would be cumbersome, as the correction factors tend to be nonlinear.},

GaN HEMT devices, exhibiting high power densities coupled with high breakdown voltages, have opened up the possibilities for highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs) exploiting the principles of waveform engineered designs. This paper summarizes the unique advantages of GaN HEMTs compared to other power transistor technologies, with examples of where such features have been exploited. Since RF power densities of GaN HEMTs are many times higher than other technologies, much attention has also been given to thermal management—examples of both commercial “off-the-shelf” packaging as well as custom heat-sinks are described. The very desirable feature of having accurate large-signal models for both discrete transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuit foundry are emphasized with a number of circuit design examples. GaN HEMT technology has been a major enabler for both very broadband high-PAs and very high-efficiency designs. This paper describes examples of broadband amplifiers, as well as several of the main areas of high-efficiency amplifier design—notably Class-D, Class-E, Class-F, and Class-J approaches, Doherty PAs, envelope-tracking techniques, and Chireix outphasing.},

abstract = {This paper presents a control method to limit the common-mode (CM) circulating current between paralleled three-phase two-level voltage-source converters (VSCs) with discontinuous space-vector pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) and interleaved switching cycles. This CM circulating current can be separated into two separate components based on their frequency; the high-frequency component, close to the switching frequency, can be effectively limited by means of passive components; the low-frequency component, close to the fundamental frequency, embodies the jumping CM circulating current observed in parallel VSCs. This is the main reason why it is usually recommended not to implement discontinuous and interleaving PWM together. The origin of this low-frequency circulating current is analyzed in detail, and based on this, a method to eliminate its presence is proposed by impeding the simultaneous use of different zero vectors between the converters. This control method only requires six additional switching actions per line cycle, presenting a minimum impact on the converter thermal design. The analysis and the feasibility of the control method are verified by simulation and experimental results.},

This paper describes the analysis of an existing power module. An optimization process based on a modification of the gate circuit geometry allows balancing current during switching phases.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This paper analyzes the problem of instability in enhancement-mode gallium nitride (GaN) transistors based half-bridge circuits. The instability may cause sustained oscillation, resulting in overvoltage, excessive electromagnetic interference (EMI), and even device breakdown. GaN devices operate in the saturation region when they conduct reversely during the dead time. Under the influence of parasitic parameters, the GaN-based half-bridge circuit exhibits positive feedback under certain conditions, thus, resulting in sustained oscillation. A small-signal model is proposed to study this positive feedback phenomenon. Like the second-order under-damped system, damping ratio is defined to determine the system's stability. Based on the model, the influence of circuit parameters on instability is investigated and guidelines to suppress the oscillation are given. Reducing the co mmon-source inductance, increasing the gate resistance of the inactive switch or connecting a diode in parallel to the inactive switch are some effective ways to suppress the oscillation. Finally, the analyses are verified by both simulation and experiment.},

@article{Zhao2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.In this paper, we carried out an analysis of the breakdown characterization method by the investigation on off-state leakage currents and breakdown curves. For conventional breakdown, seven kinds of breakdown curves are summarized and it is found that only two of them can be shown by the conventional three-terminal breakdown characterization method reasonably. For the other five kinds of breakdown curves, the value of the gate leakage current is larger than that of the drain leakage current for a certain drain-bias range. Besides, the source leakage current cannot represent the buffer leakage current, and the values and signs of them are different. These problems contradict the conventional characterization method, indicating that the conventional method should be modified to characterize the breakdown mechanisms correctly. The similar problems also exist for time-dependent breakdown. The buffer and drain-gate leakage currents were obtained by a simple method and the conventional breakdown characterization method was modified by using these two currents. The problems in the conventional breakdown characterization method are solved by using the modified method. Experiments indicate that the modified breakdown characterization method is crucial to investigate the breakdown mechanisms, especially when source-gate leakage current cannot be neglected compared with the buffer leakage current.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an improved analytical switching process model to calculate the switching loss of low-voltage enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride high-electron mobility transistors (eGaN HEMTs). The presented eGaN HEMTs models are more or less derived from silicon MOSFETs models, whereas eGaN HEMTs are different from three aspects: higher switching speed, much more reduced parasitic inductance in switching loop, and absence of reverse recovery. Applying the traditional model to eGaN HEMTs results in inaccurate prediction of switching waveforms and losses. The proposed model considers the effect of low-parasitic inductances, nonlinearity of junction capacitances, and nonlinearity of transconductance. The turn-on and turn-off switching processes are described in detail and the resulting equations can be easily solved. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by comparing the predicted switching waveforms and converter's efficiency with the experimental results, respectively. Based on the analytical model, the effects of gate resistance, gate supply voltage, and parasitic inductances on switching losses are investigated. Meanwhile, a novel current measuring method based on magnetic coupling is proposed to measure the switching current waveform with improved accuracy.},

abstract = {GaN-HEMTs suffer from trapping effects which in- creases device ON-state resistance (R DS(on) ) above its theoretical value. This increase is a function of the applied DC bias when the device is in its OFF state, and the time which the device is biased for. Thus, dynamic R DS(on) of different commercial GaN-HEMTs are characterised at different bias voltages in the paper by a proposed new measurement circuit. The time- constants associated with trapping and detrapping effects in the device are extracted using the proposed circuit and it is shown that variations in R DS(on) can be predicted using a series of RC circuit networks. A new methodology for integrating these R DS(on) predictions into existing GaN-HEMT models in standard SPICE simulators to improve model accuracy is then presented. Finally, device dynamic R DS(on) values of the model is compared and validated with the measurement when it switches in a power converter with different duty cycles and switching voltages.},

abstract = {Thermal loading of power devices are closely related to the reliability performance of the whole converter system. The electrical loading and device rating are both important factors that determine the loss and thermal behaviors of power semiconductor devices. In the existing loss and thermal models, only the electrical loadings are focused and treated as design variables, while the device rating is normally predefined by experience with limited design flexibility. Consequently, a more complete loss and thermal model is proposed in this paper, which takes into account not only the electrical loading but also the device rating as input variables. The quantified correlation between the power loss, thermal impedance, and silicon area of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is mathematically established. By this new modeling approach , all factors that have impacts to the loss and thermal profiles of the power devices can accurately be mapped, enabling more design freedom to optimize the efficiency and thermal loading of the power converter. The proposed model can be further improved by experimental tests, and it is well agreed by both circuit and finite element method (FEM) simulation results.

abstract = {Compared with the state-of-the-art Si-based power devices, enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride (E-mode GaN) transistors have better figures of merit and exhibit great potential in enabling higher switching frequency, higher efficiency, and higher power density for power converters. The bridge-leg configuration circuit, consisting of a controlling switch and a synchronous switch, is a critical component in many power converters. However, owing to the low threshold voltage and fast switching speed, E-mode GaN devices are more prone to false turn-on phenomenon in bridge-leg configuration, leading to undesirable results, such as higher switching loss, circuit oscillation, and shoot through. In order to expand gate terminal's safe operating margin without increasing reverse conduction loss during deadtime, negative gate voltage bias for turn-off and antiparallel diode could be applied to E-mode GaN device. In this paper, with consideration of strong nonlinearities in C-V and I-V characteristics of high-voltage (650 V) E-mode GaN transistors, analytical device models are first developed. Then, we develop an analytical circuit model that combines the circuit parameters with intrinsic characteristics of the high-voltage GaN transistor and antiparallel diode. Thus, key transient waveforms with regard to the false turn-on problem can be acquired, including displacement current and false triggering voltage pulse on gate terminal. The simulated waveforms are then verified on a testing board with GaN-based bridge-leg circuit. In contrast to piece-wise switching process models and PSpice simulation, the proposed model exhibits outstanding performances. To provide design guidelines for mitigating false turn-on of GaN transistor, the impacts of different circuit parameters, along with the optimum negative gate voltage bias, are investigated based on the proposed model.},

abstract = {This paper presents circuit design techniques for reducing the effects of magnetic flux, occurred from the planar transformer, on gallium nitride high-electron-mobility transistors (GaN-HEMTs) in 5-MHz 100-W high power-density LLC resonant dc-dc converters. For investigating the effects of magnetic flux on a GaN-HEMT, power device model for finite element method (FEM) simulation is proposed. In order to confirm the validity of the model, the quantitative evaluation is conducted with FEM simulation, and experiment using evaluation boards. Moreover, the optimization of printed circuit board layout is considered using the verified model with FEM simulation, for reducing the effects of magnetic flux onGaN-HEMTswhile reducing the area of converter. In the experiments, 5-MHz 48V/12V100Wunregulated LLC resonant dc-dc converter with efficient power conversion GaN-HEMTs is built as the prototype to verify the optimized layout. The maximum power efficiency can be achieved 91.28{\%}, and the power density can be achieved 32 W/cm(3).},

Instead of utilizing two adjacent active vectors at each switching period as in classic PWM strategies, this new strategy utilizes two nonadjacent active vectors in the case of low-modulation index or three consecutive active vectors in the case of high-modulation index. Analytical calculations show that this new strategy is particularly effective in terms of reducing filtering capacitor rms current for high-power factor compared to space vector PWM which is used as a reference strategy. The impact of this strategy on output current quality is also investigated.},

Together with the existing model for the output I-V characteristics, the proposed capacitance model provides the complete set of analytical equations that relate the physical design parameters to the electrical characteristics of the device. The model was verified by the experimental characterization of a HEMT. In comparison to the physics-based models implemented in Finite Element Analysis tools, the obtained capacitance model has substantially lower level of complexity and, therefore, it is more suitable for implementation into iterative design optimization algorithms. In order to verify the proposed model for such usage, the prototype of a high-frequency buck converter was built, using previously modeled GaN HEMT as the main switch. The hybrid analytical-behavioral power loss model of a high-frequency buck converter was implemented into Simplorer simulation tool, using the proposed physics-based model as the device description for the capacitive part.

abstract = {Wide-bandgap devices have been widely used to reduce the size and increase the efficiency of power converters by operating at high switching frequency, at the expense of heightened conducted electromagnetic inference emissions (EMI), of which the latter circulate through the power loop and ancillary circuitry. In effect, the parasitic input-output capacitance Ci-o of the gate-driver power supply represents a key EMI propagation path to be controlled in order to ensure the operational integrity of power converters. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated, dual-output gate drive power supply for Gallium-Nitride (GaN) 650 V half-bridge phase-legs, rated at 2 W, featuring an ultra-low Ci-o of 1.6 pF, a power density of 72 W/in3, and an efficiency of 85 {\%}. All this is attained using an active-flyback converter switching at 1 MHz using GaN devices and a Pareto-optimized transformer design minimizing its interwinding capacitances, volume, and losses. The transformer is fully embedded in PCB material, doubling as substrate for the top-side active layer of the power supply. The paper presents the complete design procedure, processing, and experimental demonstration of the proposed power supply, evaluating as well the reliability impact of the magnetic-PCB material interface in high ambient temperature applications (200 {\&}{\#}x00B0;C).

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the determination of parasitic inductance values in very fast switching power devices. To keep improving today's power converters, new technologies are studied which exhibit very low switching times. The wide band gap semi-conductors are among the key aspects of these improvements. Thanks to their internal properties, they allow very fast di/dt and dv/dt with very small footprint. Stray loop inductance needs to be kept low, as it creates high peak voltage upon switching of a transistor with fast di/dt. In particular, the stray inductance value with respect to the loop size and geometry needs to be calculated accurately at the design stage of the power converters. This paper analyzes three loop geometries and studies one with minimized stray inductance and optimal current distribution. An analytical method is proposed, which uses BiotSavard law for an accurate analytical estimation of the magnetic field intensity in the selected geometry, leading to inductance calculation. A comparison between the classical two-plate inductance estimation formula and the proposed stray inductance estimation is presented, proving more accurate value with the method proposed in the paper. Finally, an experiment has validated the new inductance estimation formula. IEEE},

abstract = {IEEE Microinverters for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power conversion systems often require voltage boost due to the low dc voltage of the PV panels. High-frequency transformer-isolated differential-mode Cuk inverter (DMCI) is an attractive topology due to its inherent voltage boost capability and high power density. A significant operational issue of the DMCI is the presence of lower-order harmonic distortion in the injected grid current. It is shown that lower-order odd and even harmonic voltages are generated with this topology. This problem is accentuated due to the low damping offered by the grid to harmonic voltages. A systematic low-complexity control design is proposed to address this issue. It is shown experimentally that the DMCI operates stably with effective attenuation of the lower-order harmonics using the proposed design. Practical operational issues of the DMCI with fast-switching GaN field-effect transistors (FETs) are analyzed and solutions proposed. It is shown that there can be significant high-frequency noise generation in the DMCI with a frequency range higher than the switching frequency. Practical solutions for resolving high-frequency issues using a combination of circuit layout design and additional passive components are proposed and validated. All of the experimental results are demonstrated on a 500 W GaN-FET based microinverter prototype.},

The paper starts by introducing the inverter topology, selected pulse width modulation scheme and followed by the device features, static, and dynamic characterization and continues with presenting and discussing the results of extensive experimental and analytical characterization. After this, the impact of GaN HEMTs on inverter volume is discussed in terms of heat sink and output filter volume analysis under different switching frequency and heat sink temperature conditions. The calculation of heat sink volume and single stage LC output filter volume are presented with respect to experimental results of the single phase prototype. The findings from static, dynamic characterization, and single phase prototype results clearly show that GaN HEMT has excellent switching performance under wide load current and heat sink temperature conditions.

abstract = {Data from the ITRS2003 roadmap for 2010 predicts voltages for microprocessors in hand-held electronics will decrease to 0.8V with current and power increasing to 4A and 3W, respectively. Consequently, low power converters will move to multimegahertz frequencies with a resulting reduction in capacitor and inductor values by factors of 5 and 20, respectively. Values required at 10 MHz, for a low power buck converter, are estimated at 130 nH and 0.6 uF, compatible with the integration of magnetics onto silicon and the concept of power supply-on-chip (PSOC). A review of magnetics-on-silicon shows that inductance values of 20 to 40nH/mm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} can be achieved for winding resistances less than 1{\&}Omega;. A 1-{\&}mu;H inductance can be achieved at 5 MHz with dc resistance of 1{\&}Omega; and a Q of four. Thin film magnetic materials, compatible with semiconductor processing, offer power loss density that is lower than ferrite by a factor of 5 at 10 MHz. Other data reported includes, lowest dc resistance values of 120 m{\&}Omega; for an inductance of 120 nH; highest Q of 15 for an inductance of 350 nH and a current of 1 A for a 1- {\&}mu;H inductor. Future technology challenges include reducing losses using high resistivity, laminated magnetic materials, and increasing current carrying capability using high aspect-ratio, electroplated copper conductors. Compatible technologies are available in the power switch, control, and packaging space. Integrated capacitor technology is still a long-term challenge with maximum reported values of 400 nF/cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

abstract = {Gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) are promising switching devices in high-efficiency and high-density dc-dc converters due to their fast switching speed and small conduction resistance. However, GaN HEMTs are very sensitive to parasitic inductance because of their high switching speed, low-threshold voltage, and small driving safety margin. Parasitic inductance can cause severe voltage overshoot and ringing, whichmay result in electromagnetic interference issues, false turnon, or even device breakdown. This paper aims at reducing the parasitic inductance (including power loop inductance and driver loop inductance) by optimizing the layout. First, a multiloop method is proposed to reduce the parasitic inductance. Optimization of both the conventional single-loop structure and the proposed multiloop structure are presented. Second, three kinds of power loop layouts based on the proposed multiloop structure are realized on PCB substrate and one of them is realized on aluminum nitride (AlN) substrate, which has higher thermal conductivity but less copper layers. The power loop inductance on PCB substrate is reduced to 0.1 nH, which is only 25{\%} of the state-of-art layout. The power loop inductance on AlN substrate is reduced to 0.22 nH. Third, the driver loop layout is optimized and achieves 50{\%} reduction of driver loop inductance compared with the conventional single-layer layout. Finally, integrated modules using the proposed layouts are built to validate the analyses and designs.},

abstract = {The emergence of wide-bandgap devices, e.g. silicon carbide (SiC), has the potential to enable very high-density power converter design with high-switching frequency operation capability. A comprehensive design tool with a holistic design approach is critical to maximise the overall system power density, e.g by identifying the optimal switching frequency. This paper presents a system level design tool that optimises the power density (volume or mass) of a 3-phase, 2-level DC-AC converter. The design tool optimises the selection of the devices, heatsink and passive components (including the design of the line, EMI and DC-link filters) to maximise the power density. The structure of the optimisation algorithm has been organised to reduce the number of potential design combinations by over 99{\%}, and thus produces fast simulation times. The design tool predicts that when SiC devices are used instead of Si ones, the power density is increased by 159.4{\%}. A 5 kW, 600 V DC-link, 3-phase, 2- level DC-AC converter was experimentally evaluated in order to confirm the accuracy of the design tool.},

Furthermore, by comparing with a current shunt to measure a GaN-HEMT switching current, it is shown that CSP is able to measure a switching current of a few nanoseconds, while it brings no influence on transistor voltage waveform measurement. The obtained results show that the use of CSP brings little parasitic inductances in the measurement circuit and it does not bring the connection of the ground to the power converter.},

abstract = {A concept of an integrated and distributed inverter for switched reluctance machines is introduced. The application at hand is an outer-rotor direct drive designed for railway traction applications. A five-phase switched reluctance machine was developed and is used to demonstrate the function of the integrated and distributed inverter. The distribution is achieved by supplying each phase coil with its own modular inverter. Each inverter module is placed evenly around the end of the stator stack next to its dedicated coil. This increases the redundancy of the drive significantly. The likelihood of phase-to-phase faults is reduced, because no overlapping end-turns are necessary. Also, the integration of machine and inverter is simplified, because the semiconductors can be evenly distributed around the machine. The concept reduces the amount of terminals between drive and vehicle to communication, power supply, and cooling, independent of the number of machine phases. With the integrated and distributed inverter new control strategies can be developed to influence machine vibration and radiated noise. In this paper, the design of the prototype, the direct torque control of the five-phase machine, and the behavior in the case of a fault inside a module is analyzed.},

In this class of problems, increased electromagnetic power density, fault tolerance, and high-temperature withstand properties are of major importance, and favored single-layer (SL) and double-layer (DL) fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) optimal topologies with different motor segmentation strategies have been compared. Under such strict nature of specifications, both operational and spatial, the implementation of advanced magnetic materials, particularly Vacoflux50 cobalt iron laminations and NMX-S43SH neodymium PMs, offer great services. The optimization methodology introduced is based on composite cost and penalty functions involving performance, efficiency, reliability, weight, and thermal criteria for multioperational behavior under normal and temporary overload conditions. An appropriate particle swarm optimization algorithm ensures fast convergence of the optimization variables. The resulting optimal SL and DL FSCW PMM configurations present certain complementary advantages, while the former one offering greater efficiency, thermal robustness, and physical segregation of the two motor parts is favored for this class of applications. Finally, the proposed motor configuration has been validated through measurements on a manufactured prototype.

The motivations for this research are similar to that for vehicles and include goals to reduce emissions and decrease fuel consumption. In traditional aircraft, multiple systems may use one type or a combination of types of energy, including electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, and pneumatic energy. However, all energy types have different drawbacks, including the sacrifice of total engine efficiency in the process of harvesting a particular energy, as with hydraulic and pneumatic systems. The goal for future aircraft is to replace most of the major systems currently utilizing nonelectric power, such as environmental controls and engine start, with new electrical systems to improve a variety of aircraft characteristics, such as efficiency, emissions, reliability, and maintenance costs. This paper provides an in-depth look into how the systems have—or will be—changed. Future aircraft capabilities such as electric taxi and gas–electric propulsion for aircraft are also included for discussion. Most recent commercial transport aircrafts are described as the current state-of-the-art electric aircraft system. Future goals, including those of NASA, are presented for future advances in MEA.},

Models of equivalent series resistance that are valid over a range of frequency and operating temperature are derived and experimentally validated. The root-mean-square values and frequency spectra of the capacitor current are analyzed with respect to three modulation strategies and various operating conditions over practical ranges of load power factor and modulation index in EV drive systems. The modeling and analysis also consider the self-heating process and resulting core temperature of the dc-link capacitors, which impacts their lifetimes. Based on an 80-kW permanent-magnet (PM) motor drive system, the application of electrolytic capacitors and film capacitors has been evaluated by both simulation and experimental tests.

abstract = {Interior type permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) have been widely used for various applications be-cause of their high efficiency and high power density. It is well known that the flux weakening control of an IPMSM can extend the operating range by reducing the back-EMF and producing reluctance torque. An IPMSM, however, ex-periences a large harmonic iron loss in the stator teeth caused by the distorted flux density. In particular, the harmonic eddy current loss significantly increases in the high speed region under flux weakening control. This paper describes a novel motor-drive system that includes an individual multi-phase drive in order to control the current and voltage in each armature winding. The proposed system can be expected to achieve high efficiency driving, a wide operating range, fail-safety and so on. Furthermore, the proposed method gives the distorted flux density distri-bution a sinusoidal waveform, because the individual control can observe and regulate the instantaneous flux linkage in each stator tooth, although the motor consists of a full-pitch distributed winding. Therefore, the proposed drive can suppress the harmonic iron loss under the flux weakening operation. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve an extensive reduction in the total iron loss in particular in the high speed region.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a design method for stepped skewing of rotor magnets to selectively eliminate the harmonics of the no-load electromotive force (EMF) and the ripple torque, which is generated by the interaction of the stator cur-rent magnetomotive force with the rotor magnet flux distribution. The method is based on the theory that a harmonic component of the ripple torque is generated by the corresponding two harmonics of the no-load EMF. An elementary unit of the proposed skewing for canceling out one harmonic EMF consists of two identical magnet blocks skewed axially. For suppressing a harmonic ripple torque, the corresponding two harmonic EMFs are canceled out by skewing two identical elementary units or a four-step skewing. In the paper, the skew angle for canceling out each harmonic EMF is theoretically obtained. It is shown that one harmonic ripple torque is almost completely suppressed by the proposed four-step skewing through two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) analyses. In addition, experiments are performed to confirm the selective elimination of one harmonic EMF and to validate the FEM analyses. By using the proposed method, a multiple-step skewing can be designed to simultaneously suppress more than one harmonic component of the ripple torque.},

abstract = {Interest in permanent magnet synchronous machines for safety-critical applications has been increasing over the years. One of the most common methods for providing fault tolerance to a permanent magnet machine is the active control from the drive side. This method requires designing machines with the lowest possible mutual coupling between phases and a self-inductance that is high enough to limit the fault currents. Fractional-slot concentrated windings have been proposed as the most advantageous solution to meet these requirements. When comparing the numerous combinations of phases, poles and slots that give rise to a fractional-slot concentrated winding, the usual criteria only focus on obtaining a single-layer winding and do not actually consider the relationship between the self-inductance and the mutual inductance between phases. Moreover, they give no recommendations regarding the optimal number of phases from a magnetic point of view. The present work aims to cover this gap by obtaining analytical expressions for the calculation of the inductances in a permanent magnet machine. The derived expressions are investigated regardless of the geometry of the machine, and the criteria for selecting the most promising combinations in terms of the machine's fault tolerance are extracted.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Mutual inductance is a phenomenon caused by the circulation of the magnetic flux in the core of an electrical machine. It is the result of the effect of the current flowing in one phase on the other phases. In conventional three-phase machines, such an effect has no influence on the electrical behaviour of the device. Although these machines are powered by power inverters, no problem should occur. The result is not the same for multi-star machines. If these machines are using a conventional winding structure, namely distributed windings, and are powered by voltage source converters, current ripples appear in the power supply lines. These current ripples are related to magnetic couplings between the stars. Designers should check these current ripples in order to stay within the limits imposed by the specifications. These electric current disturbances also provide torque ripples. With concentrated windings, a new degree of freedom appears; the configuration—number of slots/number of poles—can have a positive impact. The circulation of the magnetic flux is the initial phenomenon that produces the mutual inductance. The main goal of this discussion is to describe a design method that is able to produce not only a machine with low mutual inductance between phases, but also a multi-star machine where the stars and the phases are magnetically decoupled or less coupled. This discussion only takes into $\backslash$r$\backslash$naccount the machines that use permanent magnets mounted on the rotor surface.

The use of system integration may lead to an increase in loss density and local or component temperatures. For this reason much attention needs to be paid to the thermal design aspects of the system.

In this paper the integration of a permanent magnet machine and power electronics into a single structure with joint thermal management is investigated. An overall goal of 2 kW/kg is set for system power density. Additionally in this paper fault tolerance is introduced into the design. This will allow the system to continue functioning should a single electrical fault occur. Principle faults are identified and discussed. A 50 kW, 6 phase, 8 pole permanent magnet machine is presented with a rotor speed of 50 krpm. A symmetrical phase shifted full bridge is used to drive the permanent magnet machine, aiding the functionality of fault tolerance and enabling the use of soft switching. A mathematical model for both machine and power electronics is created and used to calculate phase currents and losses in the machine and power electronics. Finally, spatial integration and thermal management concepts are presented and analysed.},

abstract = {This paper presents optimal control of a five-phase Integrated Modular Permanent Magnet Motor for normal and open-circuit fault conditions. Finite element analysis of the motor is carried out to obtain output torque of the motor. It is found that the output torque ripple of the machine when supplied with sinusoidal currents is considerably high. An optimum control technique is presented to operate the machine with minimum torque ripple and least stator ohmic loss. Furthermore, an optimum fault tolerant control method under open-circuit fault conditions is presented. Due to the half bridge and split capacitor configuration used for this modular motor drive the neutral voltage fluctuates considerably during the fault condition. To solve this problem, a constraint to make the summation of the phase currents to zero is incorporated in the derivation of the fault tolerant optimal control strategy. Optimal currents are calculated for normal and open-circuit fault-tolerant operation of the machine. Simulation results are presented for the verification of the control methods. Although the control techniques discussed in this work are applied for the five phase modular permanent magnet machine, they can be extended for multiphase permanent magnet machines with any number of phases.},

To increase the system power density, the focus is set on system integration, meaning to integrate e-machine, inverter, control, and gearing into one common housing. The inverter integration is facilitated by multiphase motors leading to lower phase powers and thus smaller inverter modules. To overcome price uncertainties of rare earth magnets, improved hard ferrite magnets are chosen as an alternative. In this paper, a new highly integrated drivetrain with a ferrite based 9-phase synchronous motor concept is presented with special focus on the main choices leading to the particular electromagnetic and mechanical design. The advantages of an integrated triplex inverter power supply and the new mechanical arrangement of a spoke-type rotor design will be presented, without focusing on the detailed electromagnetic behavior of the machine.},

To improve drive train availability for applications in electric vehicles, the paper proposes the design of 6-phase permanent magnet machine as two independent 3-phase windings. A number of possible phase shifts between two sets of 3-phase windings due to their slot-pole combination and winding configuration is investigated and the optimum phase shift is selected by analyzing the harmonic distributions and their effect on machine performance including the rotor eddy current losses. The machine design is optimized for a given set of specifications for electric vehicle (EV), under electrical, thermal and volumetric constraints.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a promising approach for developing an integrated traction motor drive based on the Integrated Modular Motor Drive (IMMD) concept. The IMMD concept strives to meet aggressive power density and performance targets by modularizing both the machine and power electronics and then integrating them into a single combined machine-plus-drive structure. Physical integration of the power electronics inside the machine makes it highly desirable to increase the power electronics operating temperature including higher power semiconductor junction temperatures and improved device packaging.$\backslash$nRecent progress towards implementing the IMMD concept in an integrated traction motor drive is summarized in this paper. Several candidate permanent magnet (PM) machine configurations with different numbers of phases between 3 and 6 are analyzed to compare their performance characteristics and key application features. A 6-phase, 10-pole PM machine topology has been selected as the most promising configuration for meeting the major requirements in the areas of power density, efficiency, and module count. A parallel investigation of fault-tolerant distributed control configurations for the IMMD traction drive has led to selection of a heterarchical controller configuration that requires each phase module to be equipped with its own independent microcontroller operating as a peer with all of the other phase module controllers.$\backslash$nThe potential of silicon (Si) insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) operating at junction temperatures up to 200°C has been evaluated using a hardware testbed in terms of device losses and thermal issues. Based on these study results, a 10 kW phase-leg package design using Si IGBTs has been investigated including die selection, material selection, layout design, parasitic extraction and thermal characterization. Thermal performance characterization has been conducted for different packaging structures, operating conditions and coolant selections. The proposed packaging design and cooling approach can maintain the Si IGBT junction temperature below 200°C with an ambient temperature of 150°C.},

abstract = {High-power density is required in power conversion systems used in various applications, especially in electric vehicles. Driving the power devices with high frequency is one of the successful solutions to downsize a circuit's magnetic components, and hence an overall high-power density of the circuit can be realised. Therefore, GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) is widely used in many applications, owing to its high-speed switching characteristics, low power losses, and high heat and radiation resistances. However, the high-speed switching of GaN HEMT comes with a drawback. For instance, in a full-bridge inverter configuration, high-speed turn-on of one device may cause a false turn-on of the complementary device. If a power device has encountered a false turn-on, the GaN HEMT devices will suffer from overcurrent, excessive heat and is eventually destructed due to the short circuit. This phenomenon can be tackled by modifying the circuit conditions. In this Letter, the theoretical analysis of a three-phase full-bridge inverter is developed to figure out the behaviour of the GaN HEMT gate voltage, which is the key-factor parameter causing a false turn-on. On the basis of the proposed theoretical analysis, the circuit conditions which minimise the gate voltage spike are derived.},

@article{Shirabe2014,
abstract = {High motor efficiency, lower torque ripple, close to ideal sinusoidal motor current waveform, smaller filter size, etc. are a few of the advantages of using high-frequency pulsewidth modulaton (PWM) (in the range of 50 to 100 kHz) in motor drive applications. However, higher frequency PWM is also associated with voltage reflection and motor insulation breakdown issues. Due to high losses, Si IGBT-based inverters cannot be operated at high switching frequency. Work on SiC and GaN-based inverter has progressed and variable-frequency drives (VFDs) can now be operated efficiently at carrier frequencies in the 50 to 200 kHz range, using these devices because of extremely low turn-on and turn-off losses. At high frequency, physical and electrical rating of output filter reduces, thereby improving efficiency. Loss in ac motors also reduces because of sinusoidal waveform. All the above features put together improves system efficiency. This paper focuses on comparing the efficiency of Si-IGBT-based drive with a 6-in-1 GaN module-based drive, which is operating at a carrier frequency of 100 kHz with an output sine wave filter. Experimental results show the GaN-based drive has a better system efficiency compared to the standard Si IGBT-based drive.},

abstract = {The standard voltage source inverter (VSI), widely used in electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicle (EV/HEV) traction drives, requires a bulky dc bus capacitor to absorb the large switching ripple currents and prevent them from shortening the battery's life. The dc bus capacitor presents a significant barrier to meeting inverter cost, volume, and weight requirements for mass production of affordable EVs/HEVs. The large ripple currents become even more problematic for the film capacitors (the capacitor technology of choice for EVs/HEVs) in high temperature environments as their ripple current handling capability decreases rapidly with rising temperatures. It is shown in previous work that segmenting the VSI based traction drive system can significantly decrease the ripple currents and thus the size of the dc bus capacitor. This paper presents an integrated packaging scheme to reduce the system cost of a segmented traction drive.},
