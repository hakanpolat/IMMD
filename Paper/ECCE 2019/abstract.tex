\textbf{Abstract}: 
In this paper, DC link capacitor current and voltage ripple under the effect of parasitic inductances for a GaN based integrated modular motor drive (IMMD) are investigated. The variation in the interleaving scheme when inverter modules are connected in series or parallel are presented. The IMMD system used for the experiments has 4 inverter modules each having 270 V DC bus voltage and 2 kW output power.
