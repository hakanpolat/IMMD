\textbf{Abstract}: 
In this paper, the effect of parasitic inductances on power semiconductor device stress, DC link capacitor current ripple and DC link voltage ripple in a motor drive are investigated. A GaN based motor drive inverter module designed for an Integrated Modular Motor Drive (IMMD) application is considered. The actual capacitor current stress in a single module is shown to be much more adverse when the commutation inductances are taken into account. The change in the interleaving scheme is discussed when the connection inductances between inverter modules that are connected in series or parallel are considered. A comparison between series and parallel connection in a modular motor drive is performed with several aspects.
