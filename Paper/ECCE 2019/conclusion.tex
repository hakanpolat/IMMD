\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, the effects of parasitic inductances on a modular motor drive are investigated. It is shown that device stress is only affected by the power loop inductances, whereas capacitor stress is caused by the commutation inductances. In series connected converters, interleaving has no useful effect on the capacitor stress and module voltage ripple. On the other hand, capacitor stress can be reduced by parallel connection with interleavig. However, the capacitor currents are not significantly reduced when parasitic inductances are taken into account. 
In the final paper, a complete analytical model will be introduced including parasitic inductances, number of modules and the interleaving effects. Inverter modules of the aforementioned IMMD prototype will be tested with series and parallel connection combinations and the experimental results will be presented.
