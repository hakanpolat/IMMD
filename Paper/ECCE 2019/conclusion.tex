In the final paper, a complete analytical model will be introduced through which parasitic inductance, number of modules and interleaving effects can be analyzed. The variation of each stress will also be analyzed with varying switching frequency so that the relation between the resonance frequency due to capacitance and inductance combination and switching frequency will be more clear. 

The aforementioned IMMD prototype is currently on its integration and testing stage where the dedicated permanent magnet motor and control PCB are also realised. The power distribution architecture is designed such that 4 inverter modules can be connected in all-series, all-parallel or 2-series and 2-parallel fashion.

All the simulation results presented in this manuscript will be validated via experiments and presented in the final paper.
