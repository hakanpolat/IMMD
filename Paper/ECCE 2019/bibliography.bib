abstract = {— Industry is adopting GaN HEMT in 10kW-100kW and higher power systems due to the ultra-fast switching capabilities of GaN. Paralleling GaN HEMT transistors is an appealing idea to further increase the power capability and reduce conduction losses of systems. The characteristics of E-mode GaN HEMT, such as positive temperature coefficient of RDS(ON) and a temperature independent threshold voltage, are very suitable for paralleling devices. However, the main challenge for parallel operation is thought to be the diverse parasitics of the power stage and gate driver circuits, which are very sensitive to the high di/dt and dv/dt during the switching process. In this paper, an analytic model for the switching process of paralleled GaN HEMT transistors is built to analyze the effects of parasitics and device characteristics on paralleling, and the design consideration for gate driver and layout is also presented. A half bridge power stage consisting of four high-side and four low-side 60 A / 650 V GaN HEMTs in parallel is designed to undertake 240 A / 400 V hard switching on and off. Double pulse testing results are presented to confirm GaN paralleling capability.},

abstract = {The lecticans are a family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans including aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican. The C-terminal globular domains of lecticans are structurally related to selectins, consisting of a C-type lectin domain flanked by epidermal growth factor and complement regulatory protein domains. The C-type lectin domain of versican has been shown to bind tenascin-R, an extracellular matrix protein specifically expressed in the nervous system, and the interaction was presumed to be mediated by a carbohydrate-protein interaction. In this paper, we show that the C-type lectin domain of brevican, another lectican that is specifically expressed in the nervous system, also binds tenascin-R. Surprisingly, this interaction is mediated by a protein-protein interaction through the fibronectin type III domains 3-5 of tenascin-R, independent of any carbohydrates or sulfated amino acids. The lectin domains of versican and other lecticans also bind the same domain of tenascin-R by protein-protein interactions. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that brevican lectin has at least a 10-fold higher affinity than the other lectican lectins. Tenascin-R is coprecipitated with brevican from adult rat brain extracts, suggesting that tenascin-R and brevican form complexes in vivo. These results demonstrate that the C-type lectin domain can interact with fibronectin type III domains through protein-protein interactions, and suggest that brevican is a physiological tenascin-R ligand in the adult brain.},

abstract = {The lecticans are a family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans including aggrecan, versican, neurocan, and brevican. The C-terminal globular domains of lecticans are structurally related to selectins, consisting of a C-type lectin domain flanked by epidermal growth factor and complement regulatory protein domains. The C-type lectin domain of versican has been shown to bind tenascin-R, an extracellular matrix protein specifically expressed in the nervous system, and the interaction was presumed to be mediated by a carbohydrate-protein interaction. In this paper, we show that the C-type lectin domain of brevican, another lectican that is specifically expressed in the nervous system, also binds tenascin-R. Surprisingly, this interaction is mediated by a protein-protein interaction through the fibronectin type III domains 3-5 of tenascin-R, independent of any carbohydrates or sulfated amino acids. The lectin domains of versican and other lecticans also bind the same domain of tenascin-R by protein-protein interactions. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that brevican lectin has at least a 10-fold higher affinity than the other lectican lectins. Tenascin-R is coprecipitated with brevican from adult rat brain extracts, suggesting that tenascin-R and brevican form complexes in vivo. These results demonstrate that the C-type lectin domain can interact with fibronectin type III domains through protein-protein interactions, and suggest that brevican is a physiological tenascin-R ligand in the adult brain.},

Feasible slot/pole combinations of the fractional-slot concentrated winding six-phase PMSM are elicited and analyzed for scheme selection. The novel 24-slot/14-pole combination is derived from the analysis and suppression of the magnetomotive force (MMF) harmonics. By making use of alternate-teeth-wound concentrated winding configuration, two adjacent coils per phase and unequal teeth widths, the phase windings of the proposed machine is magnetically, thermally isolated, which offers potentials of modular design and fault tolerant capability. Taking advantage of the leakage component of winding inductance, 1.0 per unit short-circuit current is achieved endowing the machine with short-circuit proof capability. Optimal design of essential parameters aiming at low eddy current losses, high winding factor and short-circuit-proof ability are presented to pave the way for a high-quality system implementation.},

An improved all-teeth-wound winding disposition that changes the winding factor of each harmonic is applied to suppress harmonics. A relatively large slot leakage inductance that limits the short-circuit current (SCC) induced in the short-circuited winding is proposed to deal with short-circuit fault.

A 2D sub-domain field computational model with multi objective genetic algorithm (GA) is used for the design and performance prediction of the considered FT-PM machines. The machine electromagnetic losses including iron, magnet and winding losses are systematically computed using analytical tools. During the post processing stage a 1D analysis is employed for turn-turn fault analysis. The method calculates self and mutual inductances of both the faulty and healthy turns under a SC fault condition with respect to the fault locations, and thus SC fault current considering its location. Eight FT-PM machines with different S/P combinations are analysed. Both the performance of the machine during normal operation and induced currents during a turn-turn SC fault are investigated. To evaluate the thermal impact of each S/P combination under an inter-turn fault condition, a thermal analysis is undertaken using finite element (FE) computation. It is shown that low rotor pole number machines have better fault tolerance capability whilst high rotor pole number machines are lighter and provide higher efficiency. Results show that the influence of the S/P selection on inter-turn fault SC current needs to be considered during the design process to balance the efficiency and power density against fault tolerant criteria of the application at hand.},

abstract = {In this paper, optimal phase advances under fault-tolerant control (FTC) of a five-phase permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor (PMa-SynRM) have been proposed under different fault conditions. Critical applications where the consistency and safety are the major concerns in automotive and aerospace industries require reliable control systems. The multiphase motor is considered a promising candidate for these applications as it has redundant phases primarily for fault-tolerant operation. However, advanced FTC for a PMa-SynRM with maximization of reluctance torque has been limitedly studied until now. In the conventional approach, to maintain constant magnetomotive force under fault conditions, phase currents of a motor need to increase significantly. However, this will easily saturate the PMa-SynRM resulting in significantly reduced reluctance torque. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel phase current control method that maximizes the reluctance torque with minimum phase current. Here, a phase current control with a novel phase advance has been proposed under various fault conditions. Extensive theoretical and experimental analysis has been carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed idea with 5-hp dynamo system controlled by TI DSP F28335. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

Under faults, the five-phase PMa-SynRM is expected to run at fault-tolerant control (FTC) mode, otherwise it draws a large amount of current with a significant reduction in the reluctance torque. To successfully achieve FTC operation of five-phase PMa-SynRM, the accurate detection of a fault condition has to be preceded. With the best of these authors knowledge, the detection of faults has been limitedly studied for five-phase motors. The analysis of open-phase fault in five-phase machine involves complicated conditions including single-phase open fault, two-phase adjacent fault, and two-phase nonadjacent fault. To perform the timely fault-tolerant operation, those faults have to be accurately analyzed and detected. In this paper, a novel symmetrical components (SCs) analysis is utilized to extract the feature of those fault conditions. This analysis will provide the types of faults by logically analyzing the pattern of magnitude and phase angle changes of the fundamental signal in the SCs.

Moreover, a modified control algorithm able to enforce the vector control in damaged drives has been implemented, by cooperatively managing some or all the drives of the system. Therefore, differently from previous techniques, the fault tolerance capability is achieved by exploiting the healthy drives, rather than activating back-up inverter legs.

abstract = {The windings concentrated around the teeth offer obvious advantages for the electrical machines with radial air-gap, because the volume of copper used in the end-windings can be reduced. The Joule losses are decreased, and the efficiency is improved. These machines are still limited to applications of sub-fractional power and they generally present a reduced number of phases. In the three-phase machines, the concentrated winding is too often restricted to a winding with a short pitch of 120 electrical degrees, i.e., to a winding with performances reduced compared to the traditional structures. But there is a significant number of three-phase structures which can support a concentrated winding if the number of poles is increased. In this article, the authors present a synthesis of the structures of three-phase machines with concentrated windings. 1) In the first part, the structures with a regular distribution of the slots are presented. A systematic method is proposed to determine the windings and the performances are discussed. 2) In the second part, the authors present original structures of three-phase machines with concentrated windings which use an irregular distribution of the slots. A specific method to identify these structures is described, and a comparative analysis of the performances of the original and traditional structures is performed by using a field calculation software.},

abstract = {The research described in this thesis focuses on the mitigation of inter-turn$\backslash$nshort-circuit (SC) faults in Fault-Tolerant Permanent Magnet (FT-PM) machines. An analytical model is proposed to evaluate the inter-turn SC fault current accounting for the location in the slot of the short-circuited turn(s). As a mitigation strategy to SC faults at the design stage, a winding arrangement$\backslash$ncalled VSW (Vertically placed Strip Winding) is proposed and analysed. The proposed analytical model is benchmarked against finite element (FE) calculation and validated experimentally. The results demonstrate that the proposed$\backslash$nwinding arrangement in the slot improves the fault tolerance (FT) capability of the machine by limiting the inter-turn SC fault current regardless the fault location in the slot.$\backslash$nElectromagnetic and thermal studies are conducted to verify the merits and drawbacks of the proposed winding compared to the conventional winding using$\backslash$nround conductors (RCW). The study shows that the proposed winding$\backslash$nscheme, in addition to being fault-tolerant, has an improved bulk radial conductivity, can achieve a good fill factor, but has a significantly higher frequency-dependent AC copper loss. To predict the AC losses an analytical model based on an exact analytical 2D field solution is proposed. This model consists$\backslash$nof first solving the two-dimensional magneto-static problem based on Laplace's and Poisson's equations using the separation of variables technique. Then, based on that solved solution, by defining the tangential magnetic field$\backslash$n(Ht) at the slot opening radius, Helmholtz' equation is solved in the slot subdomain.$\backslash$nSubsequently, an FE and MATLAB{\textregistered} coupled parametric design is undertaken to maximise the VSW-wound machine's efficiency whilst maintaining its FT capability. The proposed analytical models for prediction of the SC fault current and AC copper losses are integrated into the coupled optimisation. It is shown that the effective losses of the VSW can be minimised through design parametric design while maintaining the required level of machine perfor-mance. Using an existing FT-PM machine of which the rotor is kept unchanged two stators were designed, manufactured and wound with RCW and VSW re-spectively and experimental tests are carried out to validate the analytical mod-els and the new winding concept.},

When this model is used to investigate the impact of interturn short-circuit faults in permanent-magnet (PM) machines with fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCW), the model delivers fault response predictions that agree very well with results from the finite element analysis. The model is used to show that the 24-slot/14-pole FSCW PM machine is vulnerable to very high interturn fault currents, even when the remaining turns are shorted, offsetting its advantage of low magnetic coupling between phases. FSCW-PM machines that employ aligned coils in phase windings can effectively suppress their interturn fault currents.

abstract = {Permanent-magnet (PM) motors offer potential energy savings as compared with induction motors because of the virtual elimination of rotor loss and the reduction of stator loss from operation near unity power factor. In PM machines, iron losses form a significant fraction of the total loss partly due to the nonsinusoidal flux density distribution. Design optimization therefore requires good means of predicting these iron losses. Finite-element analysis can be employed but this approach is cumbersome and costly when used in the many iterations needed in optimizing the design. This paper presents a set of improved approximate models for the prediction of iron loss. They can be used in design optimization programs and, since they are directly related to machine dimensions and material properties, they also provide quick insight into the effects of design changes. A time-stepped finite-element method is employed to evaluate the iron losses in a range of typical PM machines and the results are used to evaluate the adequacy of the models. The predictions of overall iron losses are then compared with measurements made on two PM motors.},

abstract = {Iron losses in permanent-magnet synchronous machines form a larger portion of the total losses than in induction machines and, hence, more importance should be given to the iron losses. Previously, models have been presented for the calculations of these losses, but these models still rely on finite-element simulations to obtain correction factors, which are substantial, to apply to the theoretically derived formulas in order to obtain good agreement with the experimental data. This paper points out the source of this correction factor: the neglect of the excess eddy-current loss component. In many cases, this loss component dominates the total iron losses and needs to be incorporated in the theoretical considerations. The paper also provides a more complete model of iron loss, which greatly reduces the need for calculating the correction factors using the finite-element method (FEM). This more complete model reduces design time, especially when a number of candidate designs need to be analyzed. Otherwise, the calculation of the correction factors using FEM would be cumbersome, as the correction factors tend to be nonlinear.},

abstract = { We develop an analytical model for predicting the eddy-current loss in the rotor magnets of permanent-magnet brushless machines that have a fractional number of slots per pole, when either all the teeth or only alternate teeth are wound, and in which the unwound teeth may be narrower than the wound teeth. The model enables the magnetic field distribution in the air gap and magnet regions to be determined, by neglecting the eddy-current redistribution effect and assuming that the eddy currents are resistance limited. It can account for space-harmonic magnetomotive forces (MMFs) resulting from the winding distribution and time-harmonic MMFs due to nonsinusoidal phase currents, as well as for the effect of curvature and circumferential segmentation of the magnets. We have validated the model by finite-element analysis, and used it to investigate the eddy-current loss in the magnets of three surface-mounted magnet brushless motors that have similar slot and pole numbers, and employ identical rotors but different stators, when they are operated in brushless ac (BLAC) and dc (BLDC) modes. We show that the stator winding configuration, as well as the operational mode, significantly influence the resultant eddy-current loss.},

The first example is a cruise ship with two azimuthal thrusters, both of which are equipped with 18 to 21 MW dual-stator synchronous motors and driven by two voltage source inverters (VSI) in a redundant configuration. The phase shift between the stator windings in each motor is 30 degrees, and the motors can also operate with only one stator system in case that another system is lost. The second example is LNG carriers, where one propeller is driven through a gearbox by two 12 to 15 MW dual-stator synchronous motors. The motors are supplied by VSI-type frequency converters with double inverter units and supply units, allowing each motor to operate in half power mode in case of a fault in any of these modules. The both configurations provide 75{\%} redundancy in case of the most common single faults without notably increasing the cost and complexity of the system.},

Since the motor is housed in the limited space within the wheel rim, it must have high torque density and efficiency and survive the rigors of being in-wheel in terms of environmental cycling, ingress, shock and vibration, and driver abuse. Finally, to ensure that adequate levels of functional safety are met, it is essential that failures do not lead to the loss of control of the vehicle. This paper presents studies of a fault-tolerant concept for the design of in-wheel motors. The study focused on achieving a high torque density and the ability to sustain an adequate level of performance following a failure.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE. Gallium Nitride enhancement-mode high electron mobility transistors (GaN E-HEMTs) can achieve relatively high-efficiency and high-frequency in hard-switching mode. One particular reason is that GaN E-HEMTs obtain zero reverse-recovery loss and also a zero reverse-recovery period. For silicon (Si) MOSFETs, it has been a well-known issue that their Qrris too big to switch the transistor in hard-switching mode. Researchers have made extensive efforts to calculate the reverse-recovery loss. However, few of them pay attention to the Qoss, as the Qrrdominates in the turn-on switching loss for Si MOSFETs. For GaN HEMTs, the absence of the Qrrmakes the Qossnoticeable, although the value of the Qossfor GaN HEMTs is still the smallest among both Si and Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs. This paper focus on the Eqoss loss in GaN HEMTs. The Eqoss loss mechanism, detailed calculation and detailed measurement method for GaN HEMTs are provided. In addition, the theoretical results are verified by the double-pulse test at different junction temperatures and gate resistances.},

This relationship has been characterized in both static and dynamic testing over a wide range of operating conditions, and a circuit has been constructed to implement this control scheme. The circuit uses analog components to integrate the protection feature into a commercially available GIT gate driver. The scheme was experimentally verified in a double pulse test setup for experimental verification, and its total fault response time was recorded at less than 70 ns, with 400 V dc bus and a 30 A threshold. Compared with conventional desaturation protection, which detects faults based on drain voltage rather than gate voltage, the proposed scheme offers benefits in terms of speed, temperature invariance, flexibility in threshold selection, and minimal impact on the GIT's normal switching behavior.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for open-phase fault detection of a five-phase permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor (PMa-SynRM). Under faults, the five-phase PMa-SynRM is expected to run at fault-tolerant control (FTC) mode, otherwise it draws a large amount of current with a significant reduction in the reluctance torque. To successfully achieve FTC operation of five-phase PMa-SynRM, the accurate detection of a fault condition has to be preceded. With the best of these authors knowledge, the detection of faults has been limitedly studied for five-phase motors. The analysis of open-phase fault in five-phase machine involves complicated conditions including single-phase open fault, two-phase adjacent fault, and two-phase nonadjacent fault. To perform the timely fault-tolerant operation, those faults have to be accurately analyzed and detected. In this paper, a novel symmetrical components (SCs) analysis is utilized to extract the feature of those fault conditions. This analysis will provide the types of faults by logically analyzing the pattern of magnitude and phase angle changes of the fundamental signal in the SCs. The proposed method has been comprehensively analyzed through theoretical derivation, finite-element simulations, and experimental testing through a 5 hp PMa-SynRM controlled by TI-DSP F28335.},

@article{Zhao2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.In this paper, we carried out an analysis of the breakdown characterization method by the investigation on off-state leakage currents and breakdown curves. For conventional breakdown, seven kinds of breakdown curves are summarized and it is found that only two of them can be shown by the conventional three-terminal breakdown characterization method reasonably. For the other five kinds of breakdown curves, the value of the gate leakage current is larger than that of the drain leakage current for a certain drain-bias range. Besides, the source leakage current cannot represent the buffer leakage current, and the values and signs of them are different. These problems contradict the conventional characterization method, indicating that the conventional method should be modified to characterize the breakdown mechanisms correctly. The similar problems also exist for time-dependent breakdown. The buffer and drain-gate leakage currents were obtained by a simple method and the conventional breakdown characterization method was modified by using these two currents. The problems in the conventional breakdown characterization method are solved by using the modified method. Experiments indicate that the modified breakdown characterization method is crucial to investigate the breakdown mechanisms, especially when source-gate leakage current cannot be neglected compared with the buffer leakage current.},

Under such strict nature of specifications, both operational and spatial, the implementation of advanced magnetic materials, particularly Vacoflux50 cobalt iron laminations and NMX-S43SH neodymium PMs, offer great services. The optimization methodology introduced is based on composite cost and penalty functions involving performance, efficiency, reliability, weight, and thermal criteria for multioperational behavior under normal and temporary overload conditions. An appropriate particle swarm optimization algorithm ensures fast convergence of the optimization variables. The resulting optimal SL and DL FSCW PMM configurations present certain complementary advantages, while the former one offering greater efficiency, thermal robustness, and physical segregation of the two motor parts is favored for this class of applications.

abstract = {This paper presents a holistic approach to determine the effect of online reconfiguration of the motor winding of a synchronous permanent magnet motor resulting in switching the number of turns. The analysis is based on a parameter plane, which predicts the behavior of synchronous machine designs by using only two normalized parameters, the permanent magnet flux linkage and the ratio of the quadrature axis inductance Lq to the direct axis inductance L d. This enables a fast and reliable evaluation of all alternate winding configurations under given constraints. By generating a Pareto front, superior switching configurations can be identified. An exemplary configurable winding machine-implemented in a finite element analysis (FEA)-shows a significant improvement with respect to maximum torque (increase by 20.3{\%}) and usable torque-speed operating range (increase by 5.5{\%}) compared to the best fixed-winding configuration. The contribution demonstrates that this approach is not only applicable for permanent magnet synchronous motors but also for synchronous reluctance, electrically excited synchronous and induction motors.},

abstract = {Interior type permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSMs) have been widely used for various applications be-cause of their high efficiency and high power density. It is well known that the flux weakening control of an IPMSM can extend the operating range by reducing the back-EMF and producing reluctance torque. An IPMSM, however, ex-periences a large harmonic iron loss in the stator teeth caused by the distorted flux density. In particular, the harmonic eddy current loss significantly increases in the high speed region under flux weakening control. This paper describes a novel motor-drive system that includes an individual multi-phase drive in order to control the current and voltage in each armature winding. The proposed system can be expected to achieve high efficiency driving, a wide operating range, fail-safety and so on. Furthermore, the proposed method gives the distorted flux density distri-bution a sinusoidal waveform, because the individual control can observe and regulate the instantaneous flux linkage in each stator tooth, although the motor consists of a full-pitch distributed winding. Therefore, the proposed drive can suppress the harmonic iron loss under the flux weakening operation. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve an extensive reduction in the total iron loss in particular in the high speed region.},

Based on the simulation model, an investigation of the package influence on the cascode GaN HEMT is presented, and several critical parasitic inductances are identified and verified. Finally, a detailed loss breakdown is made for a buck converter, including a comparison between hard switching and soft switching. The results indicate that the switching loss is a dominant part of the total loss under hard-switching conditions in megahertz high-frequency range and below 8{\~{}}10 A operation current; therefore, soft switching is preferred to achieve high-frequency and high-efficiency operation of the high-voltage GaN HEMT.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analytical model for input, output, and reverse capacitance of a normally ON AlGaN/GaN high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) with a gate field-plate structure, when the device is in the subthreshold regime. Together with the existing model for the output I-V characteristics, the proposed capacitance model provides the complete set of analytical equations that relate the physical design parameters to the electrical characteristics of the device. The model was verified by the experimental characterization of a HEMT. In comparison to the physics-based models implemented in Finite Element Analysis tools, the obtained capacitance model has substantially lower level of complexity and, therefore, it is more suitable for implementation into iterative design optimization algorithms. In order to verify the proposed model for such usage, the prototype of a high-frequency buck converter was built, using previously modeled GaN HEMT as the main switch. The hybrid analytical-behavioral power loss model of a high-frequency buck converter was implemented into Simplorer simulation tool, using the proposed physics-based model as the device description for the capacitive part. The efficiency measurements showed good agreement with the simulation results, even at 20 MHz of switching frequency in the low range of the output power.},

This variable frequency system is based on a generator directly driven from the aero-engine, in which the frequency is dependent on engine speed. A number of safety critical loads are placed on this system, and it is essential that failure of any one load does not affect the operation of another. The paper develops the concept of fault tolerant input converters for an electric fuel pump. The converters always act as a unity power-factor load, and can tolerate a range of failures, whilst maintaining both the operation of the pump and minimal impact on the electrical supply. Two converter types are proposed and compared for this application. The operation of these two unity power factor converters from a variable frequency supply is demonstrated. The effect of faults in the selected converters on converter operation and the supply itself is then discussed.},

This concept is called more electric aircraft (MEA), which involves the introduction of the electromechanical actuators (EMAs) and the electro-hydraulics actuators (EHAs) for the actuation of the flight surfaces of wide-body aircraft, moving from the {\^{A}}¿fly-by wire{\^{A}}¿ to the {\^{A}}¿power-by wire{\^{A}}¿ concept. The resulting step change in aircraft electrical loading will have far reaching implications for the electrical generation system. Considerable effort is being directed towards realizing the so-called more electric engine (MEE), which foresee an integration of the electrical generator directly inside the main gas turbine engine. Also the entire electrical distribution system is subject to radical revisiting, with a trend which is leaving the constant frequency AC energy distribution in favor of variable frequency or DC solutions. Hence, it is evident the MEA trend increments the technical challenges and research topics for the electrical engineering in the aeronautic applications. The aim of the paper is the presentation, from the electrical engineering point of view, of some of the most challenging application of electric machines and drives in the incoming new aircraft generation. There are too many on board electric components and systems to be analyzed: the authors centre the attention on the most safety critical drives: flight surface actuators, fuel pumps and generators.},

By making use of alternate-teeth-wound concentrated winding configuration, two adjacent coils per phase and unequal teeth widths, the phase windings of the proposed machine is magnetically, thermally isolated, which offers potentials of modular design and fault tolerant capability.

Gate signal jitter in power electronic converters, which introduces wideband noise to the power output, originates mainly from the signal isolators that are required to provide the galvanically isolated gate driver control signals. A low-jitter gate control signal is produced by employing a digital flip-flop, which uses a low-jitter isolated clock, to re-synchronize the jittery gate control signal. By utilizing the clock-enable input of the flip-flop, the gate driver can be rendered immune to high-speed common-mode transients, which is important as the Class-D power amplifier demonstrator system employs fast-switching GaN E-HEMT transistors, where the 400V switching transients exceed 300 kV $\mu$s?1.

All these attributes make the SRM a competitive solution for aircraft and automotive applications, where system reliability is a crucial feature. Therefore, in this paper, a new algorithm for real-time diagnosis of power converter faults in SRM drives is proposed. In contrast to other methods that use additional sensors or devices, the presented technique uses the measured phase currents only, which are already available for the drive control. The proposed algorithm effectively detects the inverter faulty phase and is capable of localizing the faulty power switch.

The motor is designed to satisfy the load specifications with one or two phases open or with a phase short circuited, while a failure in the rotor position sensors is remedied through a sensorless strategy. Design studies aiming to predict the faulty mode performance in case of different remedial strategies are presented. Experimental tests on the drive prototype are included, which confirm its capability to satisfy the planned degraded modes of operation.},

abstract = {Similar to the efforts to move toward electric vehicles, much research has focused on the idea of a more electric aircraft (MEA). The motivations for this research are similar to that for vehicles and include goals to reduce emissions and decrease fuel consumption. In traditional aircraft, multiple systems may use one type or a combination of types of energy, including electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, and pneumatic energy. However, all energy types have different drawbacks, including the sacrifice of total engine efficiency in the process of harvesting a particular energy, as with hydraulic and pneumatic systems. The goal for future aircraft is to replace most of the major systems currently utilizing nonelectric power, such as environmental controls and engine start, with new electrical systems to improve a variety of aircraft characteristics, such as efficiency, emissions, reliability, and maintenance costs. This paper provides an in-depth look into how the systems have—or will be—changed. Future aircraft capabilities such as electric taxi and gas–electric propulsion for aircraft are also included for discussion. Most recent commercial transport aircrafts are described as the current state-of-the-art electric aircraft system. Future goals, including those of NASA, are presented for future advances in MEA.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel ten-phase fault-tolerant permanent-magnet synchronous motor (FTPMSM) with two stators and two rotors on the same shaft. Furthermore, a concentrated, single-layer, and alternate-teeth-wound winding is adopted to enhance the fault isolation capacity of the motor. In addition, we propose a new approach to the speed control of the developed motor, which takes the electromagnetic torque ripple in the fault switch process into account. The control can guarantee the uniform boundedness and uniform ultimate boundedness of the system regardless of the load disturbance and the parameter variation, particularly for the fault switch process after a fault occurrence before the fault-tolerant control can take effect. Moreover, an optimal torque control is adopted to further improve the fault-tolerant performance, which enables a ripple-free torque operation under open-circuit and short-circuit fault conditions. Simulation and experimental results show that the FTPMSM system with the proposed control strategy has excellent fault-tolerant performance and good robustness. This paper provides an innovative approach by employing a robust control for a speed loop to guarantee the fault-tolerant performance of the proposed motor system under normal and fault conditions, even in the fault switch process.},

abstract = {Power converters are complex devices subject to failures that can lead to undesired stops. For this reason, many fault-tolerant topologies and strategies have been deeply studied, mainly focusing on improving the electromechanical behavior of the reconfigured drive after the fault. However, it is also very important to evaluate the possible increase of power losses. In this paper, a power loss analysis is performed on a current-controlled three-phase inverter supplying a permanent-magnet synchronous motor (just chosen as an example), for all the operating modes, starting from the fault occurrence until the faulty operation mode is established. This is particularly important because the effectiveness of a fault-tolerant control strategy depends on the possibility to maintain a continuous operation. The latter is ensured only if there is no such increment of the losses that the survival of the component is at risk. The simulations are validated by means of experimental tests, and the results are discussed. The method can be easily applied to other topologies and reconfiguration strategies.},

Open-circuit faults in stator windings of the machine as well as switches of the inverter are analyzed. The optimization objective is to produce ripple-free electromagnetic torque with minimum ohmic losses under open-circuit fault conditions. This is achieved by a simple closed-form equation to calculate reference optimal currents in all cases where a lookup table is utilized to represent the effect of fault type. The proposed FTC technique is easily extended to PM machines with higher number of phases. Experimental results for a five-phase PM machine drive are provided to demonstrate the proposed FTC strategy.

Consequently, a more complete loss and thermal model is proposed in this paper, which takes into account not only the electrical loading but also the device rating as input variables. The quantified correlation between the power loss, thermal impedance, and silicon area of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is mathematically established. By this new modeling approach , all factors that have impacts to the loss and thermal profiles of the power devices can accurately be mapped, enabling more design freedom to optimize the efficiency and thermal loading of the power converter.

The analysis covers both the open circuit of one and two phases and the short circuit at the machine terminal of one phase. The proposed control guarantees safe drive operation after any fault occurrence. For the sake of generality, an analytical model has been used to investigate the properties of each postfault strategy. The results are general, and they apply to PM motor of any power rating.

This relationship is then extended to be applied to an AC-AC matrix converter, to create a simple space vector modulation algorithm for a matrix converter which can be easily implemented for real-time computation in an online control system},

abstract = {Pulsewidth modulation has been one of the most intensively investigated areas of power electronics for many years, and the number and combination of permutations seem to be endless. However, a general hierarchical consensus appears to have emerged from this work which ranks space vector modulation techniques, regular sampled modulation, and sine-triangle modulation strategies in decreasing order of merit based on harmonic performance. However, what has not been clearly identified is why space vector modulation should lead to a reduced harmonic current ripple compared to regular sampled modulation, especially since it is straightforward to show that they produce identical low-frequency fundamental components. This paper addresses this issue by showing how it is the placement of the zero space vector component within the carrier interval that determines the harmonic performance of the modulation strategy, rather than any intrinsic differences between the various methods of calculating the switching instances},

abstract = {The selection of an appropriate modulation scheme plays a vital role to assure the performance of multilevel inverters. Space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) is more efficient among all other pulse width modulation (PWM) techniques due to its key characteristics like better DC voltage utilization, switching losses reduction and easiness in digital implementation. The conventional SVPWM scheme presents some computational complexities due to redundant switching states and large number of space vectors. This paper summarizes five different SVPWM techniques for multilevel inverters which are {\&}{\#}x03B1;-{\&}{\#}x03B2; frame, g-h frame, K-L frame, {\&}{\#}x03B1;{\&}{\#}x2032;-{\&}{\#}x03B2;{\&}{\#}x2032; frame and SVPWM based on imaginary coordinate system. g-h frame and K-L frame are based on 60{\&}{\#}x00B0; and 120{\&}{\#}x00B0; coordinates system respectively. To compare the result of these SVPWM schemes, the complex calculations of conventional SVP-WM are converted into simplified line voltages form. The comparison results validate all the SVPWM techniques, but the SVPWM based on imaginary coordinate is found more simple in duty ratio calculations, easier to understand and provides a better control for zero-sequence component for any level of inverter.},

This CM circulating current can be separated into two separate components based on their frequency; the high-frequency component, close to the switching frequency, can be effectively limited by means of passive components; the low-frequency component, close to the fundamental frequency, embodies the jumping CM circulating current observed in parallel VSCs. This is the main reason why it is usually recommended not to implement discontinuous and interleaving PWM together. The origin of this low-frequency circulating current is analyzed in detail, and based on this, a method to eliminate its presence is proposed by impeding the simultaneous use of different zero vectors between the converters. This control method only requires six additional switching actions per line cycle, presenting a minimum impact on the converter thermal design. The analysis and the feasibility of the control method are verified by simulation and experimental results.},

By estimating this flux linkage, the necessary average phase voltage for the next PWM-period can be calculated to control a constant instantaneous torque output. Moreover, the sampling time of the control can be extended, which allows implementation on low cost microcontrollers. Furthermore, a novel strategy of torque prediction is proposed, which allows complete elimination of inherent torque ripple during phase commutation, without using offline-calculated current or flux profiles.

abstract = {Inverters play key roles in motor drives, flexible power transmissions, and recently grid-tied renewable energy generation units. Therefore, availability and reliability of inverters have become increasingly important. Following early stage fault detections in inverters, remedial actions can extend normal operation of inverters and, in some cases, derate the system to prevent unexpected shutdowns. A remedial action typically contains a combination of hardware and software reconfigurations. The main purpose of this paper is to provide an instructive survey of existing fault-tolerance (remedial) techniques for three-phase, two-level, and multilevel inverters.},

An integration of an electric motor and a drive with wide bandgap (WBG) devices possesses numerous attractive features for electrified and decentralized actuation systems. The WBG devices are capable of operating at high junction temperature ( {\textless} 170 °C) with improved efficiency due to fast switching speed and low on-state resistance. It also leads to better performance and higher power density electrohydrostatic actuators than the traditional solutions, which are being widely adopted in industrial applications such as aerospace, robotics, automobiles, manufacturing, wind turbine, and off-road vehicles.

With the superb switching performance of GaN power FETs, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing dc-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD modules are interleaved to suppress the total voltage ripple of dc-link capacitors and to further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configurations and their coupling effect are also investigated as a part of the IMMD design. The proposed structure and design methods are verified by experimental results.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. This paper analyzes the problem of instability in enhancement-mode gallium nitride (GaN) transistors based half-bridge circuits. The instability may cause sustained oscillation, resulting in overvoltage, excessive electromagnetic interference (EMI), and even device breakdown. GaN devices operate in the saturation region when they conduct reversely during the dead time. Under the influence of parasitic parameters, the GaN-based half-bridge circuit exhibits positive feedback under certain conditions, thus, resulting in sustained oscillation. A small-signal model is proposed to study this positive feedback phenomenon. Like the second-order under-damped system, damping ratio is defined to determine the system's stability. Based on the model, the influence of circuit parameters on instability is investigated and guidelines to suppress the oscillation are given. Reducing the co mmon-source inductance, increasing the gate resistance of the inactive switch or connecting a diode in parallel to the inactive switch are some effective ways to suppress the oscillation. Finally, the analyses are verified by both simulation and experiment.},

This increase is a function of the applied DC bias when the device is in its OFF state, and the time which the device is biased for. Thus, dynamic R DS(on) of different commercial GaN-HEMTs are characterised at different bias voltages in the paper by a proposed new measurement circuit. The time- constants associated with trapping and detrapping effects in the device are extracted using the proposed circuit and it is shown that variations in R DS(on) can be predicted using a series of RC circuit networks. A new methodology for integrating these R DS(on) predictions into existing GaN-HEMT models in standard SPICE simulators to improve model accuracy is then presented. Finally, device dynamic R DS(on) values of the model is compared and validated with the measurement when it switches in a power converter with different duty cycles and switching voltages.},

Aerospace applications involve essentially safety-critical systems which should be able to overcome hardware or software faults and therefore need to be fault tolerant. A way of achieving this is to introduce variable degrees of redundancy into the system by duplicating one or all of the operations within the system itself. Looking at motor drives, multiphase machines, such as multiphase brushless dc machines, are considered to be good candidates in the design of fault-tolerant aerospace motor drives. This paper introduces a multiphase two-level inverter using a flexible and reliable field-programmable gate-array/digital-signal-processor controller for data acquisition, motor control, and fault monitoring to study the fault tolerance of such systems.},

abstract = { A physical phase variable model for permanent magnet synchronous motors is proposed. This model is initiated to pursue an accurate and fast motor model for integrated motor drive simulation. Since the full finite element (FE) model may be time consuming and the direct- and quadratic-axis (dq)-model is inaccurate, the proposed physical phase variable model eliminates these deficiencies. The proposed model is a circuit model with inductance, back electromotive force (EMF), and cogging torque calculated from nonliner transient FE solutions. The main characteristics of this model are that it is as accurate as the full FE model while giving fast computational results. The Simulink implementation of the proposed model is studied. Comparisons of the proposed model with the full FE model and the dq-model are performed. The results verify the validity of the proposed model and show its practical superiority in drives applications.},

Thus, such a strategy is an interesting solution within embedded systems. Theoretical principles of the proposed method are introduced. Then, simulation results highlight the benefits of this algorithm compared to classical PWM control. Finally, a DSP-base implementation has been performed, and effectiveness of this strategy is confirmed by experiments for a starter-generator application.},

The integrated motor design was targeted at pump and fan applications where the need to install motor drives in a separate location is often an impediment to the replacement of fixed speed motors. In order to achieve this objective the thermal and electrical design of the integrated drive have to be considered together. This paper presents the final design that achieves all these objectives, including fully tested and evaluated demonstrations of the power converter and the cooling arrangements. The final integrated motor drive design only differs from a standard motor in terms of one end plate, the terminal box and the shaft driven fan. Full practical results of the 30 kW demonstrator are presented in the paper},

@article{Choi2011a,
abstract = {This paper introduces a promising approach for developing an integrated traction motor drive based on the Integrated Modular Motor Drive (IMMD) concept. The IMMD concept strives to meet aggressive power density and performance targets by modularizing both the machine and power electronics and then integrating them into a single combined machine-plus-drive structure. Physical integration of the power electronics inside the machine makes it highly desirable to increase the power electronics operating temperature including higher power semiconductor junction temperatures and improved device packaging.$\backslash$nRecent progress towards implementing the IMMD concept in an integrated traction motor drive is summarized in this paper. Several candidate permanent magnet (PM) machine configurations with different numbers of phases between 3 and 6 are analyzed to compare their performance characteristics and key application features. A 6-phase, 10-pole PM machine topology has been selected as the most promising configuration for meeting the major requirements in the areas of power density, efficiency, and module count. A parallel investigation of fault-tolerant distributed control configurations for the IMMD traction drive has led to selection of a heterarchical controller configuration that requires each phase module to be equipped with its own independent microcontroller operating as a peer with all of the other phase module controllers.$\backslash$nThe potential of silicon (Si) insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) operating at junction temperatures up to 200°C has been evaluated using a hardware testbed in terms of device losses and thermal issues. Based on these study results, a 10 kW phase-leg package design using Si IGBTs has been investigated including die selection, material selection, layout design, parasitic extraction and thermal characterization. Thermal performance characterization has been conducted for different packaging structures, operating conditions and coolant selections. The proposed packaging design and cooling approach can maintain the Si IGBT junction temperature below 200°C with an ambient temperature of 150°C.},

abstract = {This paper investigates differences of parasitic inductances caused by DC bus bar patterns on printed circuit boards(PCB). The DC bus bar pattern on the PCB is limited depending on the layout of main circuits and the control circuits. Two patterns which are a laminated wiring pattern and a plane wiring pattern are compared in experiments and simulations. In this paper, it will be clarified that effects of the DC bus bars on PCBs such as a surge voltage of a switch in terms of the parasitic inductance depending on the circuits on PCBs. As a result, if the same parasitic inductance which is 20 nH, is realized between each wiring pattern at the same length, the plane wiring pattern requires over ten times of the pattern width compared with that of the laminated wiring pattern. Hence, the circuit size can be downsized when the laminated pattern is used. From the experimental results, the maximum surge voltage in the plane wiring pattern is larger than that in the laminated wiring pattern. In this case, the parasitic inductance value of the plane wiring pattern is three times that of the laminated wiring pattern. However, the surge voltage in the laminated pattern is reduced by 7{\%} compared with the plane wiring pattern. As a consequence, the ratio of the surge voltage does not match that of the parasitic inductance. As a result, not only the parasitic inductance of the DC bus bar but also it is necessary to consider other parasitic inductances on PCBs such as parasitic inductances into input capacitors and the path between an upper MOSFET and a lower one and so on.},

abstract = {In electric vehicle (EV) inverter systems, direct-current-link capacitors, which are bulky, heavy, and susceptible to degradation from self heating, can become a critical obstacle to high power density. This paper presents a comprehensive method for the analysis and comparative evaluation of dc-link capacitor applications to minimize the volume, mass, and capacitance. Models of equivalent series resistance that are valid over a range of frequency and operating temperature are derived and experimentally validated. The root-mean-square values and frequency spectra of the capacitor current are analyzed with respect to three modulation strategies and various operating conditions over practical ranges of load power factor and modulation index in EV drive systems. The modeling and analysis also consider the self-heating process and resulting core temperature of the dc-link capacitors, which impacts their lifetimes. Based on an 80-kW permanent-magnet (PM) motor drive system, the application of electrolytic capacitors and film capacitors has been evaluated by both simulation and experimental tests. The inverter power density is improved from 2.99 kW/L to 13.3 kW/L, without sacrificing the system performance in terms of power loss, core temperature, and lifetime.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to optimize direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generators for offshore direct drive wind turbines in order to reduce the cost of energy. A 6 MW wind turbine design is assumed and parametric electromagnetic and structural generator models are introduced for a surface-mounted magnet generator topology (using magnets with high BHmax) and a flux-concentrating variant (using magnets with lower BHmax). These are optimized using a hybrid genetic algorithm and pattern search process and the results show that the surface-mounted permanent magnet generator produces the lower cost of energy. The choice of objective function is addressed and it is found that a simplified metric incorporating generator cost and losses proxy produces similar designs to a full cost of energy calculation. Further steps to improve the quality of the model include the effect of generator mass on the design and cost of the turbine tower and foundation, which can add €0.4 m to the turbine cost. Further optimizations are carried out to show the impacts of magnetic material costs (doubling this leads to a €1.1/MWh increase in cost of energy) and generator diameter limits (increasing the upper limit from 6 to 8 m leads to a 0.9{\%} drop in cost of energy) have on the choice of optimum independent variables.},

abstract = {The flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) motor has been viewed as a highly reliable machine with both armature windings and magnets on the stator. Owing to the high torque-production capability with low torque ripple, FSPM motors with a higher number of phases are potential candidates for traction applications in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). However, existing research has mostly focused on the principles and static performance of multiphase FSPM motors, and little attention has been paid to advanced control strategies. In this paper, the fully decoupled current control of a 36/34-pole nine-phase FSPM (NP-FSPM) motor is developed and the performance under different operating conditions is investigated. The aim of the design is to alleviate cross coupling effects and unwanted low-order stator harmonic currents, to guarantee fast transient response and small steady-state error. In addition, its fault-tolerance is further elaborated. These features are very important in automotive applications where low torque pulsation, high fault-tolerant capability and high dynamic performance are of major importance. Firstly, the research status of multiphase FSPM motors is briefly reviewed. Secondly, the mathematical model in the dq reference frames and control strategies are presented. Then, the control and performance of the NP-FSPM motor are evaluated by using MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, experiments on an NP-FSPM motor prototype are carried out to validate the study.},

abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) is one of the well-known and effective strategies adopted in distribution network. The goal of DFR problem is to obtain a new topological structure for distribution feeders by rearranging the status of switches such that an optimal configuration would be obtained. The existence of Distributed Generation (DG) can affect the entire power system and especially distribution networks. This paper presents an efficient approach for multi-objective DFR problem considering the simultaneous effect of DG units. The objective functions to be investigated are 1) power losses, 2) voltage deviation of buses, 3) emission produced by DG units and distribution companies and 4) the total cost of the active power generated by DG units and distribution companies. The new evolutionary method is based on an efficient multi-objective hybrid honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) called MHBMO-SFLA. The proposed hybrid algorithm integrates the outstanding characteristics of SFLA to improve the performance of HBMO algorithm sufficiently. In the proposed MHBMO-SFLA, an external repository is considered to save non-dominated solutions which are found during the search process. Also, since the objective functions are not the same, a fuzzy clustering technique is utilized to control the size of the repository within the limits. A distribution test feeder is considered to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} Shiraz University.},

With this technique, PM motors can change negative salient poles into positive salient poles by applying the magnetization of the PM. Furthermore, we discuss the combi-nation of reversible salient poles with variable magnetic force to increase the efficiency of the motor under partial load. This paper proposes a novel PM motor that uses our proposed technique to reverse saliency and describes the principle of reversible pole saliency as well as the resulting motor characteristics. When the proposed motor operates with a negative salient pole, a higher torque is produced at low speeds; when the motor reverses to a positive salient pole, higher power and efficiency are produced at high speeds. These results confirm that the proposed motor can reverse the saliency direction of the pole and that this reversibility allows the motor to achieve high torque at low speeds and high power at high speeds. Consequently, the motor can operate over a wide range of speeds.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a stator design that consists of a combination of an alternate slot winding and dummy slots to minimize pulsating torque in surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motors. The alternate arrangement of winding coils is designed to eliminate a harmonic component of back electromotive force that gives rise to a harmonic component of pulsating torque. However, the non-uniform arrangement of slots decreases the frequency of the cogging torque by half and may aggravate torque pulsation. To compensate for the drawback or the decrease in the frequency of the cogging torque, dummy slots are introduced in the alternately slotted stator. A theoretical method is developed for the proposed stator combination. The proposed stator design is applied to a prototype in combination with other rotor magnet design techniques, such as magnet shifting and the adjustment of magnet width, to minimize pulsating torque. The results show that the designed motor reduces the ripple factor of the torque by approximately 30{\%} relative to the original value. In addition, the proposed alternate slot winding is validated by comparing the design with equal slot-winding designs optimized through finite-element method analysis.},

In this paper, a novel axial pole-pairing method is proposed to minimize cogging torque generation in a special three-phase outer-rotor PM brushless machine, which uses uneven stator poles to enhance back electromotive force (EMF). Analytical formulas of the machine's cogging torque are first derived. The new technique is compared with conventional cogging torque suppression methods by means of analytical models and comprehensive finite-element analysis (FEA). The FEA results show that the new method not only achieves effective cogging torque reduction, but also results in improved harmonic content of the back EMF. The validity of the FEA model is verified by experimental results from the prototype machines. Finally, the significance of optimizing both the load-independent machine design techniques and load-dependent driving techniques to achieve overall torque ripple minimization is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a design method for stepped skewing of rotor magnets to selectively eliminate the harmonics of the no-load electromotive force (EMF) and the ripple torque, which is generated by the interaction of the stator cur-rent magnetomotive force with the rotor magnet flux distribution. The method is based on the theory that a harmonic component of the ripple torque is generated by the corresponding two harmonics of the no-load EMF. An elementary unit of the proposed skewing for canceling out one harmonic EMF consists of two identical magnet blocks skewed axially. For suppressing a harmonic ripple torque, the corresponding two harmonic EMFs are canceled out by skewing two identical elementary units or a four-step skewing. In the paper, the skew angle for canceling out each harmonic EMF is theoretically obtained. It is shown that one harmonic ripple torque is almost completely suppressed by the proposed four-step skewing through two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element method (FEM) analyses. In addition, experiments are performed to confirm the selective elimination of one harmonic EMF and to validate the FEM analyses. By using the proposed method, a multiple-step skewing can be designed to simultaneously suppress more than one harmonic component of the ripple torque.},

GaN performance at elevated temperature is especially unique. Turn-on time increases significantly with temperature, and turn-on losses increase as a result. This phenomenon can be explained based on the relationships between junction temperature and GaN device transconductance, and between transconductance and turn-on time. An analytical relationship between temperature and turn-on loss has been derived for the 650-V GS66508 from GaN Systems, and verified with experimental results. Based on this relationship, a detailed model is developed, and a simplified scaling factor is proposed for estimating turn-on loss in e-mode GaN HFETs, using room-temperature switching characterization and typically published datasheet parameters.},

abstract = {— The medium power rating two-level three phase voltage source inverter is among the most popular power conversion systems. The typical switching frequency of the commercial medium power rating inverter, however, is limited to tens of kHz. By increasing the switching frequency and using emerging gallium-nitride devices, the size of the overall system can be greatly reduced. This paper begins by reviewing all commercially available GaN power transistors and their package technologies. The GS66516T device from GaN Systems is selected due to its suitable ratings and superior package performance. Then, a half-bridge structure is designed for this device to achieve low parasitic inductance and strong cooling capability at the same time. The dynamic characterization results of this 650V/60A Enhancement-mode GaN transistor are extracted with the proposed half-bridge structure. A gate drive circuit with comprehensive protection function is integrated. Based on the proposed phase-leg structure, a 10 kW three phase inverter prototype is built and the experimental waveform is shown at the end.},

It is prevalently acknowledged that GaN-based switching devices outperform the Si-based counterparts in many aspects such as lower power consumption, and faster switching frequencies. GaN devices will benefit many applications such as hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles, solar power inverters, industrial motor drives, and aerospace. Nevertheless, the superiorities of GaN devices in inverter design have not been fully explored by researchers, and the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the high-efficiency capabilities of inverters that can be achieved using these new devices and the resulting benefits on the thermal aspect. As a case study, 1 kW GaN FETs inverter is considered. Loss and efficiency analysis is performed under various load conditions, and the requirements on heat sink for various ambient temperatures are specified according to the loss values obtained. Analysis results are compared with conventional Si-based inverters.},

The significant drop in thermal resistance mainly occur in FR-4 PCBs with the help of thermal via.

abstract = {Thermal management plays a pivotal role in achieving high power densities in converters. Improvement on thermal performance of critical components in printed-circuit board (PCB) assembled switch mode converters is achieved by using design techniques that extend across electromagnetic, geometrical, and thermal-integration technologies. For better use of the already available PCB material, three-dimensional component layout and flexible PCB technology are utilized to gain advantages. A theory to evaluate the thermal-management effectiveness of switch mode converters is introduced based on two new figures of merit, namely thermal-management loss density and thermal-design rating. These two figures of merit quantify the effective use of thermal-management material as well as the thermal performance of a converter design. The figure-of-merit criteria allow flexibility so that it can be adjusted to an appropriate design objective. Design objectives include achieving higher power densities or achieving good reliability. The thermal-management-effectiveness theory is applied here to thermally optimize a Flyback converter that has been geometrically integrated. The design technique to adjust the thermal-management effectiveness of integrated switch mode converters to achieve a set objective, by means of the introduced figures of merit, forms the core of the publication, validated by experimental measurements},

Static and dynamic testing has been performed across the full current, voltage, and temperature range to enable GaN-based converter design using this new device. A curve tracer was used to measure Rds-on across the full operating temperature range, as well as the self-commutated reverse conduction (i.e. diode-like) behavior. Other static parameters such as transconductance and gate current were also measured. A double pulse test setup was constructed and used to measure switching loss and time at the fastest achievable switching speed, and the subsequent over-voltages due to the fast switching were characterized. Based on these results and analysis, an accurate loss model has been developed for the GS66508 to allow for GaN-based converter design and comparison with other commercially available devices in the 600-V class.},

abstract = {Gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) are promising switching devices in high-efficiency and high-density dc-dc converters due to their fast switching speed and small conduction resistance. However, GaN HEMTs are very sensitive to parasitic inductance because of their high switching speed, low-threshold voltage, and small driving safety margin. Parasitic inductance can cause severe voltage overshoot and ringing, whichmay result in electromagnetic interference issues, false turnon, or even device breakdown. This paper aims at reducing the parasitic inductance (including power loop inductance and driver loop inductance) by optimizing the layout. First, a multiloop method is proposed to reduce the parasitic inductance. Optimization of both the conventional single-loop structure and the proposed multiloop structure are presented. Second, three kinds of power loop layouts based on the proposed multiloop structure are realized on PCB substrate and one of them is realized on aluminum nitride (AlN) substrate, which has higher thermal conductivity but less copper layers. The power loop inductance on PCB substrate is reduced to 0.1 nH, which is only 25{\%} of the state-of-art layout. The power loop inductance on AlN substrate is reduced to 0.22 nH. Third, the driver loop layout is optimized and achieves 50{\%} reduction of driver loop inductance compared with the conventional single-layer layout. Finally, integrated modules using the proposed layouts are built to validate the analyses and designs.},

abstract = {-This paper designed the gate driver circuits and optimized the PCB layout in a 7.2kW battery charger using paralleled GaN HEMTs. 650V/60A enhancement mode GaN HEMTs provided by GaN Systems Inc are adopted. To optimize the switching performance of paralleled GaN HEMTs with low loss and high reliability, effects of parasitic inductance and capacitance are modeled and analyzed. Through cancelling the flux in the commutation loop, the power-loop parasitic inductance is reduced to only 0.7nH, which significantly decreases the electrical stress in the switch turn-off process. A diverse-parameter gate driver design has been proposed to achieve the reliable switching off. The Finite-Element-Analysis and Spice simulation show our current design could effectively suppress the voltage overshoot and gate-drive ringing on HEMTs. Experiments were carried out on both double pulse test platform and the 7.2kW charger to verify the proposed design strategy.},

abstract = {Compared with the state-of-the-art Si-based power devices, enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride (E-mode GaN) transistors have better figures of merit and exhibit great potential in enabling higher switching frequency, higher efficiency, and higher power density for power converters. The bridge-leg configuration circuit, consisting of a controlling switch and a synchronous switch, is a critical component in many power converters. However, owing to the low threshold voltage and fast switching speed, E-mode GaN devices are more prone to false turn-on phenomenon in bridge-leg configuration, leading to undesirable results, such as higher switching loss, circuit oscillation, and shoot through. In order to expand gate terminal's safe operating margin without increasing reverse conduction loss during deadtime, negative gate voltage bias for turn-off and antiparallel diode could be applied to E-mode GaN device. In this paper, with consideration of strong nonlinearities in C-V and I-V characteristics of high-voltage (650 V) E-mode GaN transistors, analytical device models are first developed. Then, we develop an analytical circuit model that combines the circuit parameters with intrinsic characteristics of the high-voltage GaN transistor and antiparallel diode. Thus, key transient waveforms with regard to the false turn-on problem can be acquired, including displacement current and false triggering voltage pulse on gate terminal. The simulated waveforms are then verified on a testing board with GaN-based bridge-leg circuit. In contrast to piece-wise switching process models and PSpice simulation, the proposed model exhibits outstanding performances. To provide design guidelines for mitigating false turn-on of GaN transistor, the impacts of different circuit parameters, along with the optimum negative gate voltage bias, are investigated based on the proposed model.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an improved analytical switching process model to calculate the switching loss of low-voltage enhancement-mode Gallium Nitride high-electron mobility transistors (eGaN HEMTs). The presented eGaN HEMTs models are more or less derived from silicon MOSFETs models, whereas eGaN HEMTs are different from three aspects: higher switching speed, much more reduced parasitic inductance in switching loop, and absence of reverse recovery. Applying the traditional model to eGaN HEMTs results in inaccurate prediction of switching waveforms and losses. The proposed model considers the effect of low-parasitic inductances, nonlinearity of junction capacitances, and nonlinearity of transconductance. The turn-on and turn-off switching processes are described in detail and the resulting equations can be easily solved. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by comparing the predicted switching waveforms and converter's efficiency with the experimental results, respectively. Based on the analytical model, the effects of gate resistance, gate supply voltage, and parasitic inductances on switching losses are investigated. Meanwhile, a novel current measuring method based on magnetic coupling is proposed to measure the switching current waveform with improved accuracy.},

abstract = {Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor (GaN HEMT) is an emerging wide band gap power device in recent years. Using a cascoded structure, the GaN HEMT can be combined with a low voltage MOSFET to make the combination behave as a normally-off device. This paper investigates the soft-switching behavior of cascode GaN HEMT in the phase-leg structure. The analysis reveals some internal device behaviors during the soft-switching transition, which are not found in the non-cascode device. Due to the internal feedback of the cascode structure, the channel current of the internal GaN HEMT drops to zero quickly, leading to extremely low turn-off loss. However, it has been found that there are switching energy loss dissipated in the internal GaN HEMT during the turn-on transient, although the external waveforms of the cascode GaN HEMT exhibit zero voltage switching. The fundamental reason is that ratio of the sum of MOSFET output capacitance and internal GaN HEMT input capacitance to the internal GaN HEMT output capacitance is quite low. Based on the simulation, by adding additional capacitance on the gate source terminals of internal GaN HEMT, these losses can be mitigated. Experimental tests using a commercially available GaN device are presented which show nearly 400 mW of loss at 1 MHz switching frequency in four different load current conditions.},

abstract = {The emergence of wide-bandgap devices, e.g. silicon carbide (SiC), has the potential to enable very high-density power converter design with high-switching frequency operation capability. A comprehensive design tool with a holistic design approach is critical to maximise the overall system power density, e.g by identifying the optimal switching frequency. This paper presents a system level design tool that optimises the power density (volume or mass) of a 3-phase, 2-level DC-AC converter. The design tool optimises the selection of the devices, heatsink and passive components (including the design of the line, EMI and DC-link filters) to maximise the power density. The structure of the optimisation algorithm has been organised to reduce the number of potential design combinations by over 99{\%}, and thus produces fast simulation times. The design tool predicts that when SiC devices are used instead of Si ones, the power density is increased by 159.4{\%}. A 5 kW, 600 V DC-link, 3-phase, 2- level DC-AC converter was experimentally evaluated in order to confirm the accuracy of the design tool.},

abstract = {A metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) (rating at 500 V/24 A) half-bridge power switching subassembly with gate drivers has been fabricated, employing a planar integration technology, in which an integrated power chips stage is built by embedding chips in a coplanar ceramic substrate with a metallization thin-film interconnection built up onto it. This deposited metallization not only bonds the power chips, but also provides the second-level interconnect wiring. The associated components are mounted on top of the integrated power stage. This packaging scheme results in a three-dimensional (3-D) multiple chips/components assembly with the capability of functional integration. In this paper, the electrical and thermal parameters of this packaged module have been experimentally and theoretically characterized. The procedures adopted for the defined fabrication processes are presented. In addition to the characteristics of the planar integration process, the improved electrical and thermal performance has been demonstrated.},

abstract = {Data from the ITRS2003 roadmap for 2010 predicts voltages for microprocessors in hand-held electronics will decrease to 0.8V with current and power increasing to 4A and 3W, respectively. Consequently, low power converters will move to multimegahertz frequencies with a resulting reduction in capacitor and inductor values by factors of 5 and 20, respectively. Values required at 10 MHz, for a low power buck converter, are estimated at 130 nH and 0.6 uF, compatible with the integration of magnetics onto silicon and the concept of power supply-on-chip (PSOC). A review of magnetics-on-silicon shows that inductance values of 20 to 40nH/mm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} can be achieved for winding resistances less than 1{\&}Omega;. A 1-{\&}mu;H inductance can be achieved at 5 MHz with dc resistance of 1{\&}Omega; and a Q of four. Thin film magnetic materials, compatible with semiconductor processing, offer power loss density that is lower than ferrite by a factor of 5 at 10 MHz. Other data reported includes, lowest dc resistance values of 120 m{\&}Omega; for an inductance of 120 nH; highest Q of 15 for an inductance of 350 nH and a current of 1 A for a 1- {\&}mu;H inductor. Future technology challenges include reducing losses using high resistivity, laminated magnetic materials, and increasing current carrying capability using high aspect-ratio, electroplated copper conductors. Compatible technologies are available in the power switch, control, and packaging space. Integrated capacitor technology is still a long-term challenge with maximum reported values of 400 nF/cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

Compared to the current state of the art, the salient feature of the proposed designs is elimination and/or reduction of undesirable space harmonics which result from the existing fractional-slot per phase per pole permanent magnet machines with concentric windings. This will bring the benefits of significant reduction of the eddy current loss in the rotor permanent magnets, short end-winding and hence reduced copper loss and copper usage, increased power/torque density, reduction in manufacturing cost, and improved energy efficiency. Although the proposed technique is primarily aimed for brushless permanent magnet machines, it is also applicable to synchronous reluctance machines, induction machines and synchronous wound field machines. The proposed technique is applied to the design of an interior mounted permanent magnet machine for electric vehicle traction applications, and demonstrated by the measurements on a prototype machine.},

abstract = {In this paper a novel method of determining optimal stator winding layouts for the permanent magnet with fractional slot concentrated winding machines is presented. This method based on a multiobject if genetic algorithm coupled to an analytical model of the MMF produced by the stator windings aims to reduce the harmonic content while maintaining a good winding factor for the working harmonic. The advantage of such an approach is that new degrees of freedom (irregular slot distribution, non-uniform distribution of the number of turns) likely to improve the distribution of the MMF waveform are taken into account. The example of application is given for two specific three phase windings; the first is characterized by a working harmonic of order five and the second by a working harmonic of order seven.},

abstract = {Fractional-slot PM machines have several advantages, but they suffer from the high contents of space harmonics in the air-gap MMF distribution. The MMF space harmonic amplitude and frequency depend on the particular combination of number of slots and poles. Such harmonics induce losses in the rotor since they are not synchronous with the rotor speed. This paper compares two kind of machines with the same stator lamination but with different number of phases, a three phase and a five-phase PM machine. Several winding configurations are compared, changing the number of poles but maintaining the same number of slots. Although in each case there is a reduction in terms of harmonic contents, it is shown that rotor losses reduction is lower than expected. Some considerations about the harmonic impact are given.},

@article{Martinez-Iturralde2015,
abstract = {Interest in permanent magnet synchronous machines for safety-critical applications has been increasing over the years. One of the most common methods for providing fault tolerance to a permanent magnet machine is the active control from the drive side. This method requires designing machines with the lowest possible mutual coupling between phases and a self-inductance that is high enough to limit the fault currents. Fractional-slot concentrated windings have been proposed as the most advantageous solution to meet these requirements. When comparing the numerous combinations of phases, poles and slots that give rise to a fractional-slot concentrated winding, the usual criteria only focus on obtaining a single-layer winding and do not actually consider the relationship between the self-inductance and the mutual inductance between phases. Moreover, they give no recommendations regarding the optimal number of phases from a magnetic point of view. The present work aims to cover this gap by obtaining analytical expressions for the calculation of the inductances in a permanent magnet machine. The derived expressions are investigated regardless of the geometry of the machine, and the criteria for selecting the most promising combinations in terms of the machine's fault tolerance are extracted.},

abstract = {The requirements for driving gallium nitride (GaN) heterostructure field-effect transistors (HFETs) and the design of a resonant drive circuit for GaN power HFET switches are discussed in this paper. The use of wideband III-nitride (such as GaN) devices today is limited to telecom and low-power applications. The current lack of high-frequency high-power drivers prevents their application in power converters. The proposed circuit is based upon resonant switching transition techniques, by means of an LC tag, to recover part of the power back into the voltage source in order to reduce the power loss. This circuit also uses level shifters to generate the zero and negative gate-source voltages required to turn the GaN HFET on and off, and it is highly tolerant to input-signal timing variances. The circuit reduces the overall power consumed in the driver and thus reduces the power loss. This is particularly important for high-frequency driver operation to take full advantage, in terms of efficiency, of the superior switching speed of GaN devices. In this paper, the topology of the low-power-loss high-speed drive circuit is introduced. Some simulation results and preliminary experimental measurements are discussed.},

The switching process is illustrated in detail, including the interaction of the low voltage Si MOSFET and the high voltage GaN HEMT in cascode configuration. The switching loss is obtained by solving the equivalent circuits during the switching transition. The analytical results show that the turn-on loss dominates in hard-switching conditions while the turn-off loss is negligible, due to the intrinsic current source driving mechanism. The accuracy of the proposed model is validated by numerous experimental results.

@article{Barre2015,
abstract = {Mutual inductance is a phenomenon caused by the circulation of the magnetic flux in the core of an electrical machine. It is the result of the effect of the current flowing in one phase on the other phases. In conventional three-phase machines, such an effect has no influence on the electrical behaviour of the device. Although these machines are powered by power inverters, no problem should occur. The result is not the same for multi-star machines. If these machines are using a conventional winding structure, namely distributed windings, and are powered by voltage source converters, current ripples appear in the power supply lines. These current ripples are related to magnetic couplings between the stars. Designers should check these current ripples in order to stay within the limits imposed by the specifications. These electric current disturbances also provide torque ripples. With concentrated windings, a new degree of freedom appears; the configuration—number of slots/number of poles—can have a positive impact. The circulation of the magnetic flux is the initial phenomenon that produces the mutual inductance. The main goal of this discussion is to describe a design method that is able to produce not only a machine with low mutual inductance between phases, but also a multi-star machine where the stars and the phases are magnetically decoupled or less coupled. This discussion only takes into $\backslash$r$\backslash$naccount the machines that use permanent magnets mounted on the rotor surface. This $\backslash$r$\backslash$narticle is part of a study aimed at designing a high efficiency generator using fractional-slot $\backslash$r$\backslash$nconcentrated-windings (FSCW).},

abstract = {Many geared electric drives can benefit from removing the gearbox and driving directly the load at low speed using a permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM). PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are particularly attractive in low-speed direct drives since they allow, among other advantages, a high number of poles with a limited number of slots. Therefore, this thesis is dedicated to PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings designed for low-speed directdrive applications. First, the design features specific to PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings are presented and illustrated with examples based on finite-element (FE) simulations. Especially, it is shown that the selections of the stator core manufacturing method, the number of winding layers, the combination of pole and slot numbers, and the geometry of the tooth tips are crucial during the design stage of the machine. Second, the benefits of removing the gearbox in a 4.5 kW, 50 rpm mixer used in a waste-water treatment plant are investigated. With its PMSM having buried ferrite magnets and concentrated windings, the designed direct-drive mixer has a higher efficiency than the commercialized geared mixer, but it is also heavier and more expensive due to the larger required housing, shaft and seals. In addition, the cost of the stator core and coil assembly was also higher than expected. Therefore, the difficulties in manufacturing a stator core with concentrated windings are investigated. Mainly due to economical aspects, no prototype motor has been built for the direct-drive mixer. Finally, measurements on a prototype motor at disposal having a large constantpower speed range are performed. Three methods to measure the inductances without using a position sensor are provided and compared. One of the methods is a new test at load conditions to determine the inductance without the knowledge of the rotor position. Results from this method agree well with a conventional blocked rotor test, as well as with results from 3D-FE simulations. Furthermore, the measurements of the magnetic flux obtained with search coils placed in different parts of the stator are analyzed. The analysis allows highlighting the zigzag flux flowing from one magnet to another through a tooth tip, which is characteristic of PMSMs with non-overlapping concentrated windings. It is shown that this zigzag flux leakage causes high iron losses in the tooth tips that represent approximately 50{\%} of the stator iron losses under field weakening operation. Using these measurements, the 3D-FE model of the prototype is also validated thoroughly.},

Instead of utilizing two adjacent active vectors at each switching period as in classic PWM strategies, this new strategy utilizes two nonadjacent active vectors in the case of low-modulation index or three consecutive active vectors in the case of high-modulation index. Analytical calculations show that this new strategy is particularly effective in terms of reducing filtering capacitor rms current for high-power factor compared to space vector PWM which is used as a reference strategy. The impact of this strategy on output current quality is also investigated.},

Compared with numerous previous works focusing on energy storage passives, the proposed approach considers input EMI filters and various operating modes. The spectrum of the pulsating phase-leg voltage with discontinuous space vector modulation scheme (DPWM) is analyzed, based on which the relationship between the switching frequency and the EMI filter parameters is studied. Then the rules for selecting line inductance and DC link capacitance are derived from the consideration of the current ripple and system stability requirement. The impact of DC link ripple current and failure mode operation is also included.

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of the input voltage unbalance and sags on the dc-bus electrolytic capacitors in adjustable-speed drives (ASDs) in order to predict their impact on expected capacitor lifetime. The key phenomenon that causes these problems is the transition of the rectifier stage from three-phase to single-phase operation. Since the equivalent series resistance increases at low frequencies, the low-order harmonic current components (e.g., 120 and 240 Hz) contribute disproportionately to the capacitor power losses and temperature rise, resulting in reduced lifetime. Closed-form expressions are developed for predicting these effects including the impact of finite line impedance, finite bus capacitance, and varying load. The impact of inverter space-vector pulsewidth-modulation switching on the capacitor loss is also included. Simulations and experimental tests are used to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the closed-form analysis using a 5-hp ASD system},

abstract = {Gallium–nitride power transistor (GaN HEMT) and integrated circuit technologies have matured dramatically over the last few years, and many hundreds of thousands of devices have been manufactured and fielded in applications ranging from pulsed radars and counter-IED jammers to CATV modules and fourth-generation infrastructure base-stations. GaN HEMT devices, exhibiting high power densities coupled with high breakdown voltages, have opened up the possibilities for highly efficient power amplifiers (PAs) exploiting the principles of waveform engineered designs. This paper summarizes the unique advantages of GaN HEMTs compared to other power transistor technologies, with examples of where such features have been exploited. Since RF power densities of GaN HEMTs are many times higher than other technologies, much attention has also been given to thermal management—examples of both commercial “off-the-shelf” packaging as well as custom heat-sinks are described. The very desirable feature of having accurate large-signal models for both discrete transistors and monolithic microwave integrated circuit foundry are emphasized with a number of circuit design examples. GaN HEMT technology has been a major enabler for both very broadband high-PAs and very high-efficiency designs. This paper describes examples of broadband amplifiers, as well as several of the main areas of high-efficiency amplifier design—notably Class-D, Class-E, Class-F, and Class-J approaches, Doherty PAs, envelope-tracking techniques, and Chireix outphasing.},

abstract = {This paper presents an overview of motor drive technologies used for safety-critical aerospace applications, with a particular focus placed on the choice of candidate machines and their drive topologies. Aircraft applications demand high reliability, high availability, and high power density while aiming to reduce weight, complexity, fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. New electric driven systems can meet these requirements and also provide significant technical and economic improvements over conventional mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems. Fault-tolerant motor drives can be achieved by partitioning and redundancy through the use of multichannel three-phase systems or multiple single-phase modules. Analytical methods are adopted to compare caged induction, reluctance, and PM motor technologies and their relative merits. The analysis suggests that the dual (or triple) three-phase PMAC motor drive may be a favored choice for general aerospace applications, striking a balance between necessary redundancy and undue complexity, while maintaining a balanced operation following a failure. The modular single-phase approach offers a good compromise between size and complexity but suffers from high total harmonic distortion of the supply and high torque ripple when faulted. For each specific aircraft application, a parametrical optimization of the suitable motor configuration is needed through a coupled electromagnetic and thermal analysis, and should be verified by finite-element analysis.},

abstract = {Pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) ac drives generate high differential-mode (DM) motor voltages due to the reflected wave phenomenon. The common-mode (CM) voltage produced by a PWM inverter also has fast transitions that result in high peak currents to ground. For low-power ac drives, this can present several issues, such as pump-up of the dc bus and failure of the power module due to high instantaneous currents that are often undetected because of the typical sampling algorithm used. In this paper, existing drive output filter solutions are reviewed, and a new filter design is presented, which has integrated DM and CM impedance with damping matched to typical cable surge impedance. This eliminates reflections of both DM and CM traveling waves and also reduces peak cable charging currents. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate that the new filter has improved performance to reduce motor DM and CM voltages and drive output CM current, thus mitigating the issues specifically seen with low-power ac drives. Complete design details for the filter and a particular implementation of the integrated DM and CM reactor are also presented.},

abstract = {Currently, assemblies of power semiconductor switches and their associated drive circuitry are available in modules. MOSFETs and IGBTs are used as switches and these elec- tric gated devices facilitate the incorporation of gate driving functions in the module. These mod- ules are sometimes also provided with limited internal sensing and protection functions. From a few 100 watts downward, one finds silicon monolithic technology as the integration vehicle, while upward into the multi-kilowatt range, mixed mode module construction is used. This incorporates monolithic, hybrid, surface mount and wirebond technology. However, a close examination of the applications in motor drives and power supplies indicates that there has been no dramatic volume reduction of the subsystem. The power semiconductor modules have shrunk the power switching part of the converter, but the bulk of the subsystem volume still comprises the associated control, sensing, electromagnetic power passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors) and interconnect structures. The article addresses the improvement of power processing technology through advanced inte- gration of power electronics. The goal of a subsystem in a module necessitates this advanced inte- gration. The central philosophy of the technology development research in the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Power Electronic Systems is to advance the state of the art by providing the concept of integrated power electronics modules (IPEMs). The technology underpinning such an IPEM approach is discussed. The fundamental functions in electronic power processing, the materials, processes and integration approaches and future concepts are explained. Ample use is made of illustrations, photographs of integrated modules and subsystems to en- hance the value of the article to the non-specialist},

abstract = {A concept of an integrated and distributed inverter for switched reluctance machines is introduced. The application at hand is an outer-rotor direct drive designed for railway traction applications. A five-phase switched reluctance machine was developed and is used to demonstrate the function of the integrated and distributed inverter. The distribution is achieved by supplying each phase coil with its own modular inverter. Each inverter module is placed evenly around the end of the stator stack next to its dedicated coil. This increases the redundancy of the drive significantly. The likelihood of phase-to-phase faults is reduced, because no overlapping end-turns are necessary. Also, the integration of machine and inverter is simplified, because the semiconductors can be evenly distributed around the machine. The concept reduces the amount of terminals between drive and vehicle to communication, power supply, and cooling, independent of the number of machine phases. With the integrated and distributed inverter new control strategies can be developed to influence machine vibration and radiated noise. In this paper, the design of the prototype, the direct torque control of the five-phase machine, and the behavior in the case of a fault inside a module is analyzed.},

Three recommendations are made, while, for a general application ASD with sinusoidal input current, the choice is given by the price of four diodes against a RB-IGBT.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {This paper explores the use of GaN MOSFETs and series-connected inverter segments to realize an IMMD. The proposed IMMD topology reduces the segment voltage and offers an opportunity to utilize wide bandgap 200V GaN MOSFETs. Consequently, a reduction in IMMD size is achieved by eliminating inverter heat sink and optimizing the choice of DC-link capacitors. Gate signals of the IMMD segments are shifted (interleaved) to cancel the capacitor voltage ripple and further reduce the capacitor size. Motor winding configuration and coupling effect are also investigated to match with the IMMD design. An actively controlled balancing resistor is programmed to balance the voltages of series connected IMMD segments. Furthermore, this paper presents simulation results as well as experiment results to validate the proposed design.},

abstract = {This paper presents optimal control of a five-phase Integrated Modular Permanent Magnet Motor for normal and open-circuit fault conditions. Finite element analysis of the motor is carried out to obtain output torque of the motor. It is found that the output torque ripple of the machine when supplied with sinusoidal currents is considerably high. An optimum control technique is presented to operate the machine with minimum torque ripple and least stator ohmic loss. Furthermore, an optimum fault tolerant control method under open-circuit fault conditions is presented. Due to the half bridge and split capacitor configuration used for this modular motor drive the neutral voltage fluctuates considerably during the fault condition. To solve this problem, a constraint to make the summation of the phase currents to zero is incorporated in the derivation of the fault tolerant optimal control strategy. Optimal currents are calculated for normal and open-circuit fault-tolerant operation of the machine. Simulation results are presented for the verification of the control methods. Although the control techniques discussed in this work are applied for the five phase modular permanent magnet machine, they can be extended for multiphase permanent magnet machines with any number of phases.},

abstract = {The integration of an electrical machine and power electronics promises many benefits, the largest being an increase in power density. The use of system integration may lead to an increase in loss density and local or component temperatures. For this reason much attention needs to be paid to the thermal design aspects of the system. In the aerospace industry weight and reliability are of significant importance. In this paper the integration of a permanent magnet machine and power electronics into a single structure with joint thermal management is investigated. An overall goal of 2 kW/kg is set for system power density. Additionally in this paper fault tolerance is introduced into the design. This will allow the system to continue functioning should a single electrical fault occur. Principle faults are identified and discussed. A 50 kW, 6 phase, 8 pole permanent magnet machine is presented with a rotor speed of 50 krpm. A symmetrical phase shifted full bridge is used to drive the permanent magnet machine, aiding the functionality of fault tolerance and enabling the use of soft switching. A mathematical model for both machine and power electronics is created and used to calculate phase currents and losses in the machine and power electronics. Finally, spatial integration and thermal management concepts are presented and analysed.},

New regulations to impose better interaction with the grid are expected to force the ASD manufacturers to add major changes to their products in order to improve the input current quality which may additionally provide other benefits such as regulated dc-link voltage and better immunity to unbalanced voltage supply.

The power electronic components were mounted on the inside of a new end cover which was equipped with an extensive array of fins cooled by air from the external fan. The electronic components were insulated from the air in the end region of the motor. A heat sink plate was installed within the motor behind the end cover to conduct the heat from the motor that would otherwise have been dissipated through the end cover. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to model the ventilation and heat transfer from the new end cover and to develop improved fan geometries. It was concluded that CFD can be used effectively to design motor cooling systems. An improved fan geometry was designed to keep the power electronics cool under high ambient temperatures with the motor running at full load},

abstract = {The standard voltage source inverter (VSI), widely used in electric vehicle/hybrid electric vehicle (EV/HEV) traction drives, requires a bulky dc bus capacitor to absorb the large switching ripple currents and prevent them from shortening the battery's life. The dc bus capacitor presents a significant barrier to meeting inverter cost, volume, and weight requirements for mass production of affordable EVs/HEVs. The large ripple currents become even more problematic for the film capacitors (the capacitor technology of choice for EVs/HEVs) in high temperature environments as their ripple current handling capability decreases rapidly with rising temperatures. It is shown in previous work that segmenting the VSI based traction drive system can significantly decrease the ripple currents and thus the size of the dc bus capacitor. This paper presents an integrated packaging scheme to reduce the system cost of a segmented traction drive.},

This paper outlines the current state of art for the power electronic converter technologies which enables greater integration in electric drives. Investigations into the supply options, state of the art devices, switching frequency selection, filtering requirements and system modularity options are explored and future trends are discussed.},
