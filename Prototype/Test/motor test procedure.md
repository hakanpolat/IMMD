##### The test procedure for the modular motor

Requirements:
1. Asynchronous machine coupled to the shaft of the motor
2. Torque and speed transducer coupled to the shaft
3. Bi-directional drive for the asynchronous motor
4. Oscilloscope, voltage probes, current probes
5. 3-phase drive
6. Thermometers
7. LCR meter

###### Off-line measurements
1. Measure the phase resistances via an LCR meter at DC and different frequencies.
2. Measure the phase inductances via an LCR meter at DC and different frequencies.

###### Open-circuit tests
1. Use the asynchr. motor to drive the PMSM (with open-circuited windings) in the range of 0 to 600 rpm. Measure the back-emf (waveform) of all coils.
2. Obtain the fundamental and harmonics of the back-emf in an off-line manner for 600 rpm.
3. Obtain the back-emf vs speed characteristics (0-600 rpm).
4. Obtain the PM flux linkages.

###### Short-circuit tests
1. Use the asynchr. motor to drive the PMSM (with short-circuited windings) at low speeds until the short circuit current reaches 1.2 times the rated current. Obtain the short-circuit current waveform of all coils.
2. Obtain the current vs speed.
3. Obtain the torque values (braking torque).

###### Light-load tests
1. Drive the PMSM with series connected windings (Use a commercial drive for this purpose). Use the asynchr. machine as the load. Apply constant V/f. The speed is expected to be as 400 rpm max. Adjust V and f accordingly.
2. Adjust the load torque at nearly zero. Observe the voltage and current waveforms.
3. Increase the load torque until 0.25 of the rated torque and observe torque, speed, voltage and current values.

###### Full-load tests
1. Use the same setup and increase the load torque until rated torque.
2. Observe torque, speed, voltage and current values.

###### IMMD tests (light load)
1. Mount the integrated motor drive unit (the whole package). Use the asynchr. machine as the load. Apply constant V/f. Maximum speed is 600 rpm this time. Adjust V and f accordingly.
2. Adjust the load torque at nearly zero. Use 4-parallel configuration of the IMMD. Observe the voltage and current waveforms.
3. Increase the load torque until 0.25 of the rated torque and observe torque, speed, voltage and current values.
4. Obtain the performance of the drive before proceeding any further. Look for any unbalance between modules.

###### IMMD tests (full load)
1. Use the same setup and increase the load torque until rated torque.
2. Observe torque, speed, voltage and current values.
3. Obtain the performance of the drive before proceeding any further.

###### IMMD tests (2S-2P)
1. Now, use 2-series and 2-parallel configuration of the IMMD. Adjust the load torque at nearly zero. Observe the voltage and current waveforms.
2. Look for any unbalance between modules. Obtain the performance of the drive before proceeding any further.
3. Increase the load torque until 0.25 of the rated torque and observe torque, speed, voltage and current values.
